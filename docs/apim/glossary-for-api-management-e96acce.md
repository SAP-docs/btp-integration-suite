</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

API Policy

</td>
<td valign="top">

API Management provides capabilities to define the behavior of an API by using 'policies.' A policy is a program that executes a specific function at runtime. They provide the flexibility to add common functionalities on an API without having to code them individually each time. Policies provide features to secure APIs, control the API traffic, and transform message formats. You can also customize the behavior of an API by adding scripts and attaching them to policies.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

API Provider

</td>
<td valign="top">

An API provider is an abstraction for a system that defines the connection details for services running on specific hosts whose details you want to access. It also displays data through a programmatically consumable service or an API.

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

API Proxy

</td>
<td valign="top">

An API proxy is a masked URL that disconnects the app-surfacing API from your backend services, protecting those apps from backend code changes.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Application

</td>
<td valign="top">

Applications include the Web or mobile applications that consume the exposed APIs. When you create an application, you select the product to include in this application. For each application that you create, API Management generates an app key and secret. Use this key to gain access to multiple products.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Application Key

</td>
<td valign="top">

An application key is an encryption code assigned to a specific application. Different applications have different application keys. This key validates if the API requested was associated to a particular application. After having created an application, the developer uses the application key to consume the APIs.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Build APIs

</td>
<td valign="top">

Build API proxies prominently and configure API policies as steps in the API flow. Customize API behavior using code. Plus, modify from or to any protocol.

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Client SDK

</td>
<td valign="top">

A client software development kit \(SDK\) is available for developers through a noncommercial license on open-source sites.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Consume API

</td>
<td valign="top">
