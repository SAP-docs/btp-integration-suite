For more information, see [Activating and Managing Capabilities](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/activating-and-managing-capabilities?q=Create%20an%20API%20Provider&version=CLOUD). For visual instructions on how to set up and configure API Management capability from Integration Suite, see [Set Up API Management from Integration Suite](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/api-mgmt-isuite-initial-setup.html) tutorial published on SAP site.

-   You already have a subaccount and have enable the Cloud Foundry environment in this subaccount. For more information, see [Create a Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/05280a123d3044ae97457a25b3013918.html?q=entitlements).

-   An *API Management, API portal* entitlement has been created for your subaccount. For more information, see [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/5ba357b4fa1e4de4b9fcc4ae771609da.html?q=entitlements).

## Context

You should have API Management, API portal subscription to set up the API portal application.

> ### Note:  
> Ensure that you don’t have an instance of a starter plan created in the same subaccount where you plan to create an API Management, API portal subscription. Also, note that API Management capabilities from Integration Suite and API Management subscriptions using the stand-alone tile can’t coexist in the same subaccount.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to SAP BTP Cockpit and navigate to your subaccount.

2.  Navigate to *Service Marketplace* search for *API Management, API portal* tile and choose *Create*.

    Alternatively, navigate to *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*, and choose *Create*.

3.  On the *New Instances and Subscriptions* dialog, choose Integration Suite as the *Service*, select the *Standard* plan from the dropdown list, and choose *Create*.

    Wait for the subscription to complete successfully.

4.  Choose *View Subscription* on the *Creation in Progress* dialog.

    Check the status of the submission in subscriptions section on the *Instances and Subscriptions* page. If the subscription is successful you’ll notice the status of the *API Management, API portal* changes to *Subscribed*.

5.  To access the API Management, API portal, you must first assign the *APIManagement.Selfservice.Administrator* role to yourself.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you choose *Go to Application* without assigning the *APIManagement.Selfservice.Administrator* role, an application authentication error appears. If the error persists after assigning the role, clear your web browser cache, and log out of the application and log on again.

    To assign the role:

    1.  On the navigation pane, under *Security*, choose *Users*.

    2.  Select your Username and under *Role Collections* section, choose *Assign Role Collection*.

    3.  In the resulting dialog box, select the *APIManagement.Selfservice.Administrator* role and choose *Assign Role Collection*.


6.  Navigate back to the *Instances and Subscriptions* page, choose *API Management, API portal*, select <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> Actions and choose *Go To Application*.

    You’re navigated to the *API Portal*.

7.  On the *Configure the API Management Service* screen, select the following and choose *Set Up*:

    -   Select the *Account type*:

        -   Select the *Non Production* account type for non-business critical activities, such as integrating test systems, testing new scenarios, performance testing, and sandbox activities.
        -   Select the *Production* account type for business critical usages, such as integrating production systems, and productive APIs.

    -   In the *Virtual Host* section, enter the *Host Alias*.

        > ### Note:  
        > The virtual host alias allows a maximum of 63 characters.

    -   Provide an email ID in the *Notification Contact* field to receive updates.


    In the *Set-up Confirmation* window, review the provided details and choose *Confirm* to start the onboarding process.

    You’re redirected to a progress window, which states *API Management Service Setup In Progress*.

    The *Configuration* process is triggered, where the necessary resources are provisioned for you. It’s followed by *Testing the Setup* process, where a simple API proxy is deployed and invoked to check that everything is set up properly.

    When the processes complete, the indicators turn green to indicate that the processes are successful. A *Release Notification* mail is sent out to the email IDs provided in the *Configure the API Management Service* screen. This email contains details of the newly set up API Management service on your account.

    The API Management, API portal application is now configured.

8.  You must log out of the*API Portal* and login again.

    Now, you can create APIs, build API proxies as a service provider, or use APIs and other convenient services.

## Next Steps

To start publishing the API portal content, you must enable the API Business Hub Enterprise. To publish the API portal content on the API Business Hub Enterprise located in the same subaccount, see [Set Up Developer Hub Application Using the Standalone Tile](set-up-developer-hub-application-using-the-standalone-tile-80c0519.md).
