# Assigning Role Collections to Users

Role collections enable you to group together the roles you create. The role collections you define can be assigned to users logged on to SAP ID service.



## Procedure

1.  In your web browser, open *SAP BTP Cockpit* and choose the relevant subaccount.

2.  In the left-hand pane, choose *Security* \> *Role Collections*

3.  Choose the role collection to which you want to assign users.

4.  Go to the *Users* section and choose *Edit*.

5.  Enter the user ID of the user that you want to assign to the role collection. If the user only exists in a connected identity provider, you must choose the identity provider and type in the e-mail address.

6.  \(Optional\) To add more users, choose :heavy_plus_sign: \(Add a user\).

7.  Save your changes.
