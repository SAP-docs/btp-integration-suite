# API Documentation

This section contains additional instructions on how to effectively use and integrate with an API.

The standard documentation for APIs is already available on the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/APIMgmt/all).

It provides you with a concise reference manual containing additional information required to work with various entities in the API portal. For example, when to expect a $batch call, the format of a $batch call, information about expected headers, payload format, how to create/update single and multiple records, mandatory and optional fields, and, so on.
