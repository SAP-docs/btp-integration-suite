# Statistics Collector Policy

This policy enables you to collect statistics for data in a message, such as product ID, price, REST action, client and target URL, and message length.

The data comes from flow variables predefined by API Management or custom variables that you define. The statistics data is passed to the analytics server, which analyzes the statistics and generates reports. This can be viewed by creating custom charts.

> ### Note:  
> To use the Statistics Collector policy, you must create custom dimensions and measures. For more information, see [Create Custom Dimensions and Measures](create-custom-dimensions-and-measures-ba211be.md).

Only one Statistics Collector policy should be attached to a single API proxy. If there are multiple Statistics Collector policies in a proxy, then the last one to execute determines the data written to the analytics server. You can attach the policy in one of the following locations:

An example payload for the policy is as follows:

> ### Code Syntax:  
> ```
> <!-- The policy collects data for each request and passes to the analytics server, in the below policy, 
> the data is colleted from productID and the price variables. if the variables are not set, the default values are used -->
> 
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
> <StatisticsCollector xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt">
>     <Statistics>
>         <Statistic name="productID" ref="product.id" type="string">999999</Statistic>
>         <Statistic name="price" ref="product.price" type="string">0</Statistic>
>     </Statistics>
> </StatisticsCollector>
> ```

> ### Note:  
> If you attempt to apply a policy template that includes a Statistic Collector policy with the Statistic name='clientIP' to an API proxy, the application of the policy template will fail because 'clientIP' is a reserved word in Cloud Foundry API Management analytics. To address this issue, we have introduced a default prefix, "**custom\_**", which will be automatically appended to all custom metric names. For example, if the Statistic name is "clientIP", it will be displayed as "**custom\_clientIP**".

> ### Remember:  
> If any changes are made to the existing policy, the API proxy must be redeployed.

The following table describes the attributes of the **`<Statistic>`** element:

N/A

<td valign="top">

The name is used to reference the data collected for the specified variable. While viewing analytics data, use this name to reference the data collected about the variable specified by the `ref` attribute. If the variable specified by `ref` is undefined on a request or response, then `defaultStatValue` specifies the value collected for the variable. If you omit the default value, no data is collected for the variable when the variable is undefined.

The following restrictions apply:

-   Names cannot be multiple-word \(no spaces\).

-   No spaces, m dashes, quotation marks, underscores, hyphens, or periods.

-   No special characters.

The flow variable for which you are collecting statistics. This variable can be a flow variable predefined by API Management or a custom variable that you define in your API proxy. The `ref` attribute often references a custom variable defined by the Extract Variables policy.

Specifies the data type of the variable specified by the `ref` attribute.

For data of type String, reference the statistical data as a Dimension in a custom report. For numerical data types \(integer/float/long/double\), reference the statistical data in a custom report as a Metric. The value of type can be omitted only if `ref` refers to a predefined API Management flow variable or the `type` is declared in the XML payload of the Extract Variables policy.
