A client software development kit \(SDK\) is available for developers through a non-commercial license on open source sites.

In the API portal, at the top-right corner, choose *Navigation Links* \(![](images/Finalgrid_1a621ca.png)\) and select *Client SDK* \(![](images/clientsdk_f85baa6.png)\). On selecting the client SDK, you are navigated to the maven repository, where you can download this package.

For more information, see [SAP API Management Client SDK 2.0.1](https://help.sap.com/doc/sap-api-management-client-sdk/Cloud/en-US/Client%20SDK_2.0.1.pdf).

You can also download the package from [https://int.repositories.cloud.sap/artifactory/deploy-releases/com/sap/apimgmt/client/sdk/apim-client-sdk/2.0.1/apim-client-sdk-2.0.1.zip](https://int.repositories.cloud.sap/artifactory/deploy-releases/com/sap/apimgmt/client/sdk/apim-client-sdk/2.0.1/apim-client-sdk-2.0.1.zip).

> ### Note:  
> We will always offer support for the latest version of the SDK.

> ### Note:  
> As part of SAP’s ongoing commitment to enhanced cloud security, the root Certificate Authority \(CA\) used for HTTPS communication in SAP API Management \(both design-time and runtime\) is being updated to **DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5**.
> 
> This change may affect your integration scenarios if your client systems do not trust the new root certificate. To avoid SSL-related connection errors, please ensure that the **DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5** certificate is imported into your client systems’ trust stores before **August 1, 2025**.
> 
> You can download the certificate [here](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertTLSRSA4096RootG5.crt).
