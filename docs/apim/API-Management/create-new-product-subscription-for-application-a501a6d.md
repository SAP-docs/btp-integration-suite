# Create New Product Subscription for Application

To manage API consumption, create a new product subscription for application. This will provide you with the credentials needed for secure access and allow you to catogorize and analyze data for APIs used by applications.

In API Management, similar APIs are bundled together to form products, which are published in the catalog. An application developer enters necessary details to register to Developer Hub. After successful registration, the application developer can explore the required products and APIs to create a subscription for application.

After the subscription is successfully created, the system generates a key and secret.

Depending on the authentication method, you can either use the generated key directly or obtain an access token by using the token URL along with the key and secret combination to access the APIs.
