API Management technology helps you to share digital assets and enable developer communities to consume these assets in new channels, devices, and user interfaces. Available in the cloud, the technology helps promote coinnovation among employees, partners, and the developer community. To gain better insights about consumer needs, you can empower employees and partners with access to critical information and increase reach to a wider customer base.

The Cloud Foundry environment gives you the ability to subscribe to the API Management service, while you may choose a public infrastructure to run the API Management service, such as Amazon Web Services or microsoft Azure.

Get started by subscribing to API portal and Developer Hub applications where you can create APIs and consume them. For setting up the API Portal application, see [here](APIM-Initial-Setup/set-up-api-portal-application-29c281b.md). Once the API portal is setup, see [here](APIM-Initial-Setup/set-up-developer-hub-application-using-the-standalone-tile-80c0519.md) to set up the Developer Hub application.
