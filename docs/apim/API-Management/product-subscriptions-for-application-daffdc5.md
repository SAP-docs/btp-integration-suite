# Product Subscriptions for Application

A product subscription for application is a discrete representation of the actual developer’s application. It acts as a container for managing and organizing API consumption, providing developers with the tools and credentials needed to access APIs securely and effectively.

Here’s a breakdown of what an application represents:

-   **API access and credentials:** The developers obtain the necessary credentials—such as keys or OAuth tokens—to interact with SAP APIs. These credentials ensure secure communication and access control, safeguarding against unauthorized use.
-   **Monitoring and analytics:**: These subscriptions also offer tools for monitoring API usage and performance. Developers can access analytics regarding API calls, error rates, and other metrics that help optimize application performance and troubleshoot issues. For more information, see [View Susbcriptions, Costs, and Analyze Reports](view-susbcriptions-costs-and-analyze-reports-fca4d8c.md).

When subscribing to a product for an application, developers have the following options:

-   **Create New Application**
-   **Add to an Existing Application**
