# Onboard an Application Developer

Explains how API administrators can onboard application developers so they can access the Developer Hub.



## Context

A user must be onboarded to Developer Hub only via Self-registration or **Add User** flow.

To provide application developers with access to the Developer Hub, the API Administrator first has to onboard them. The steps to onboard an application developer are as follows:



## Procedure

1.  The application developers log on to the Developer Hub application with their IDP user credentials, and register to the Developer Hub. For more information, see [Register on Developer Hub](register-on-developer-hub-c85fafe.md).

2.  The API administrator approves or rejects the request to access the Developer Hub. For more information, see [Managing the Access Request of the Users](managing-the-access-request-of-the-users-8b79ee8.md).

    If you haven’t enabled the automatic creation of shadow users, and you've not explicitly created shadow users for your developers, then they’re unable to log on to the application, and they’re asked to contact the administrator. For more information, see [Shadow Users](APIM-Initial-Setup/shadow-users-a0f5fe5.md)
