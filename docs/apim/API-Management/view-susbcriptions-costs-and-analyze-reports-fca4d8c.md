# View Susbcriptions, Costs, and Analyze Reports

From the *My Workspace* page you can view your subscriptions, costs, and analyze reports.

Subscriptions created by you or any other subscription developers are displayed under the *Subscriptions* section. For a created subscription, you can view the total number of calls made in the current month. From this page, you can create a new subscription or create an subscription on behalf of a user, mostly application developers.

By default, the *Cost* section displays the cost incurred in the last 6 months and the cost incurred in the current month. However, you can choose a month to view the cost incurred for that month.

You can analyze the performance of all your subscriptions and get an overview of the subscription usage from the *Performance Analytics* section. In this section the runtime data is gathered, analyzed, and displayed as charts, headers, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\). For more information, see [Analyze Applications](analyze-applications-deb57dd.md).

You can also navigate to the *Error Analytics* tab to view the error-related charts and KPIs for all the subscriptions for the selected time period.
