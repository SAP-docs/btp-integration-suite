# Transport API Management Artifacts via SAP Cloud Transport Management Service

You can use the SAP Cloud Transport Management service \(TMS\) for exporting, importing, and shipping the APIs and their related artifacts from the development or test environment to the production environment. For example, you can design and test API portal content on the test tenant and then use the Cloud Transport Management service to move the content to the target tenant.
