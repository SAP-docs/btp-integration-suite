API Management

</td>
<td valign="top">

-   Creates simple digital experiences for your consumers, partners, and employees.


-   Uses a technology that helps you to share digital assets and enable developer communities to consume these assets in new channels, devices, and user interfaces. Available in the cloud, the technology helps promote co- innovation among employees, partners, and the developer community.


-   Reduces complexity by leveraging a single provisioning platform \(API Platform\) to provide unified access and governance of APIs across a heterogeneous landscape.


-   Provides one experience for managing and monitoring all APIs across various data platforms and is enriched with real-time analytics and enables consumers to access relevant data directly in a secure manner. Selective data can be exposed while reducing the risk of security breaches.

**API** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

APIs are Application Programming Interfaces. They comprise a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. APIs define sets of requirements that govern how applications communicate with one another. They facilitate interaction by selectively exposing certain functionalities, allowing different applications, websites, or devices to communicate effectively with each other

> ### Note:  
> API Management supports OData, REST, and SOAP services.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Product** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

A product is a bundle of APIs. It contains metadata specific to your business for monitoring or analytics. For example, all APIs related to CRM can be bundled as one CRM product. API Management collects data for analyzing the products.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Developer** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

One or more developers can create applications in the API Management account. A developer can consume APIs but cannot create APIs.

To create an application, the developer must have registered the account. After having created an application, the developer uses the app \(application\) key to consuming the APIs.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Application** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Applications include the Web or mobile applications that consume the exposed APIs. When you create an application, you select the product to include in this application. For each application that you create, API Management generates an app key and secret. Use this key to gain access to multiple products. Developers create one or more applications using the APIs you expose.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**App Key** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Based on the authorization mechanism you define for your APIs; the application passes an app \(application\) key together with every request to your APIs. If that key is valid, the request is permitted. API Management supports different types of authentication, such as a simple API key, OAuth, and so on.
