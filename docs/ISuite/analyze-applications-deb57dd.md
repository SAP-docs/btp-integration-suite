# Analyze Applications

Use analytics capabilities to analyze application usage, performance, and error count.

API Management provides comprehensive analytics capabilities to understand application consumption. The runtime data is gathered, analyzed, and displayed as charts, headers, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\).

As an application developer, navigate to *My Workspace* to view the analytics information. By default, the analytics section displays the data for all the applications subscribed by you. All charts are displayed based on the Application Developer context.

The analytics information can be viewed as *Performance Analytics* and *Error Analytics*.

-   **Performance Analytics**: Displays the performance-related charts and KPIs for the selected time period. Following table describes the charts used to analyze the performance of all applications:
