# Job Management

Organize and schedule your existing system jobs, and add new jobs manually.



<a name="loio4146fa5f2d094ea9820e82c53790fe86__section_ezf_zpb_ycc"/>

## Context

You can perform the following types of jobs, also refereed to as *Actions*:

-   *Cleanup Data Store Entries*. Delete data store entries that have reached the retention time.

-   *Cleanup Monitoring Data*. Clean up monitoring data by deleting message processing log \(MPL\) data for messages in their final state. You can also delete the aggregated data of tenants if the creation date is within the specified number of days from the command's execution date.

-   *Cleanup Trace Entries*. Delete trace messages that have reached the retention time.

-   *Cleanup Diagnostic Data*. Delete manually created diagnostic tasks and automatically generated heap dumps. This job also deletes empty working directories that were created by the Worker component on the shared file system but are no longer in use.

Per default, *Cleanup Data Store Entries*, *Cleanup Monitoring Data*, and *Cleanup Trace Entries* are scheduled during the installation time. However, you must schedule *Cleanup Diagnostic Data* manually.

The overview screen shows a list of all your existing jobs. For each of the jobs, the following information is available:
