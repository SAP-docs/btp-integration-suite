## Accounts

Information on how global accounts and subaccounts correspond to your landscape.



### Global Accounts

Global accounts are region and environment independent. A global account can contain one or more subaccounts in which you deploy applications, use Services, and manage your subscriptions. Within a global account, you manage all of your subaccounts.



### Subaccounts

Subaccounts let you structure a global account according to your organization’s and project’s requirements with regard to members, authorizations, and entitlements.

Subaccounts in a global account are independent from each other. It’s important to consider with respect to security, member management, data management, data migration, integration, and so on, when you plan your landscape and overall architecture. Each subaccount is associated with a region, which is the physical location where applications, data, or Services are hosted. The specific region is relevant when you deploy applications and access the SAP BTP cockpit using the corresponding cockpit URL. The region assigned to your subaccount doesn't have to be directly related to your location. You could be located in the United States, for example, but operate your subaccount in Europe. The entitlements and quotas that are purchased for a global account have to be assigned to the individual subaccounts.
