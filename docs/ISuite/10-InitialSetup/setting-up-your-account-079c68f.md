## Context

You are a global account administrator. After you've received your logon data by email, follow the steps detailed in[Create a Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/create-subaccount?version=Cloud) to create sub accounts in your global account. Once the subaccounts are created, the sub account administrator can subscribe to SAP Integration Suite. See [Subscribing and Configuring Initial Access to SAP Integration Suite](subscribing-and-configuring-initial-access-to-sap-integration-suite-8a3c8b7.md).

> ### Note:  
> SAP Integration Suite service runs only on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.
> 
> If you’ve subscribed to Process Integration, API Management, or Open Connector services in your existing subaccount, then please subscribe to the SAP Integration Suite service in a new subaccount. For more details, see [KBA](https://itsm.services.sap/now/cwf/agent/record/kb_template_kcs_article/57881a6e3b907a1c4ec2519e53e45a5b)
