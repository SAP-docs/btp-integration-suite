# Publish APIs Managed by Integration Suite

You can also publish API whose lifecycle is managed by Integration Suite. This is unlike the APIs you discover from business systems. The APIs you discover from business systems are those whose lifecycle is currently not managed.

To publish the APIs managed by Integration Suite, first bundle them as products and then publish the products. Once published, the products appear in the Developer Hub catalog. For more information see, [Publish API Proxies](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/publish-apis?version=CLOUD).
