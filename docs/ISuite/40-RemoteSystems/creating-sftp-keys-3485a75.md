You can set up reliable file transfer based on SSH File Transfer Protocol \(SFTP\). SFTP is an enhancement of the Secure Shell \(SSH\) network protocol.



## Context

This section covers all steps to generate the required security artifacts for a tenant to be connected as SFTP client to an SFTP server.



## Procedure

1.  Choose the *Keystore* tile in the *Manage Security* section.

2.  In the *Current* tab, choose *Create*.

3.  Choose *SSH Key* from the popup Menu.

4.  Fill out the required data.

    > ### Note:  
    > The recommended Key Size is 4096 bit.

5.  Choose *Create* to add the SSH key pair to the keystore.
