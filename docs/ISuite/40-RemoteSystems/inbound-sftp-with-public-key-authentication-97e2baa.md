# Inbound SFTP With Public Key Authentication



For an SFTP client connected to an SFTP server using the Public Key authentication option, the following artifacts have to be generated and stored at the locations summarized in the following table. The table also shows which artifacts need to be exchanged between the client and the server \(during the onboarding process\):

Public keys of all connected SFTP servers

A public key is used in order to authenticate the SFTP server \(as known host\) on the SFTP client side. Public keys of all connected SFTP servers are stored in a *<known\_hosts\>* file on the client side.

> ### Note:  
> The *<known\_hosts\>* file contains the public keys and addresses of the trusted SFTP servers. The client checks if the server is a trusted participant by evaluating a *<known\_hosts\>* file on the client side: If the server's public key is listed there, the identity of the server is confirmed.

> ### Note:  
> Generating the public key of the SFTP server is the task of the expert that hosts the SFTP server.

Private key of SFTP client \(stored on client\)

A tenant can connect as an SFTP client to an SFTP server \(the latter either hosted at SAP or in the customer landscape\).

The following figure shows the basic setup of components used for SFTP for inbound communication \(when the data flow is directed from an SFTP server to the tenant\).

To specify the technical details of the message flow from the SFTP sender to the tenant \(SFTP client\), a **sender SFTP adapter** has to be configured for the related integration flow.
