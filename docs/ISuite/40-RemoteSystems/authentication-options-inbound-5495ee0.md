# Authentication Options \(Inbound\)

For inbound communication, different ways are supported how the sender can authenticate itself against Cloud Integration.

We use **inbound** to refer to the communication direction when a sender system sends a message to the integration platform.

-   **Basic authentication**

    The calling entity is authenticated based on credentials \(user name and password\).

-   **Client-certificate authentication** 

-   **OAuth 2.0**

    OAuth allows you to set up authentication scenarios without the need to share credentials.

    See:

    -   [Protecting Applications with OAuth 2.0](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?b7b589334d444293a2a91e0ef4234136.html)
