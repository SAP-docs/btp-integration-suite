# Introduction

You can connect various kinds of remote systems to the cloud-based integration platform using protocols such as HTTP/S, SSH and SMTP/S. Each communication protocol comes with certain options to protect the message exchange \(security options\).



## Kind of Systems to Connect to Cloud Integration

To give you an idea of which **kinds of remote systems** can be connected to the integration platform, here are some typical examples \(this is not a complete list\):

-   On-premise systems, for example, SAP systems based on SAP NetWeaver

-   SFTP servers

-   Cloud applications, for example, SAP SuccessFactors or SAP Cloud for Customer

-   Other systems such as e-mail servers or SOAP clients


Depending on the kind of system to connect, a certain communication **protocol** is to be considered, as will be explained in the next section.

To support dedicated kinds of systems \(through dedicated communication protocols\), the integration platform provides certain **adapters**. An adapter allows you to configure the details of the technical communication channel between the remote system and the integration platform.



## Supported Protocols

First task when setting up an integration scenario is to set up a secure transport channel between the remote system and Cloud Integration. The following protocols can be used: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure \(HTTPS\), SSH File Transfer Protocol \(SFTP\) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\), respectively SMTP secured with transport layer security \(SMTPS\).

> ### Note:  
> Note that HTTPS is based on the Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) protocol.

The following table provides more information on the different aspects to consider for each protocol.

</table>

For each protocol, different authentication options are supported - ways how the connected systems prove their trustworthiness against each other during connection setup. Connection setup is performed differently, depending on whether inbound communication \(when a remote system as a sender calls Cloud Integration\) or outbound communication \(when Cloud Integration calls a remote system which, in turn, is then considered as the receiver\) is configured. The detailed procedure also depends on the chosen protocol and authentication option.

> ### Note:  
> Basic authentication is recommended for test purposes only. For productive scenarios, we recommend that you use *certificate-based authentication*.



## Adapters

The following figure illustrates some options for kinds of systems to connect to Cloud Integration. Both communication directions are considered: systems sending messages to Cloud Integration and systems that receive messages from Cloud Integration. The figure also shows which communication protocols and the Cloud Integration adapters that are to be configured in order to enable Cloud Integration to connect to the respective kind of system. Note that the figure only shows some typical use cases and is not complete.

> ### Note:  
> Adapters exchange data with remote components that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

Enables asynchronous messaging by using message queues.

The sender adapter consumes messages from a queue. The messages are processed concurrently.

To prevent situations where the JMS adapter tries again and again to process a failed \(large\) message, you can store messages \(where the processing stopped unexpectedly\) in a dead-letter queue after two retries.

Certain constraints apply with regard to the number and capacity of involved queues, as well as for the headers and exchange properties defined in the integration flow before the message is saved to the queue \(as described in the product documentation\).
