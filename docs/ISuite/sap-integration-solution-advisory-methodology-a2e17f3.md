# SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology

SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology \(ISA-M\) is a structured approach for defining an integration strategy for your organization.

The basic approach to ISA-M is that in the first phase you specify certain technology-agnostic integration requirements relevant for your organization's integration strategy \(integration domains, integration styles, and integration use-case patterns\). In the second phase, you map these criteria to those integration technologies that best fit to your customer context.

The standard content of Integration Assessment is subject to change throughout the standard content life cycle.

The assessment process is composed of the following main steps:

1.  Identify the integration domains relevant for your organization.

    Integration domains are typical areas in a hybrid landscape where integration is needed, for example, cloud-to-on-premise or cloud-to-cloud integration.

    See: [Integration Domains](integration-domains-e8360d2.md)

2.  Identify the relevant integration styles and integration use-case patterns.

    Integration styles and integration use-case patterns comprise a set of typical, technology-agnostic integration use cases.

    -   Integration styles determine high-level integration categories such as, **process integration** , **data integration**, **integration with things** .

    -   Integration use-case patterns help you to refine the relevant integration styles. For example, the use case pattern **A2A integration** refines an integration use case for the **process integration** style.


    See: [Integration Styles and Integration Use Case Patterns](integration-styles-and-integration-use-case-patterns-770909d.md)

3.  Validate the key characteristics that are relevant for your integration architecture.

    Key characteristics are criteria that help enterprise architects and integration architects to map integration styles to the relevant capabilities of integration technologies.

    See: [Key Characteristics](key-characteristics-c16258e.md)

4.  Based on your settings, the system maps the selected set of integration domains, integration styles, and use-case patterns to the best suitable integration technology.

    See: [Technology Mapping](technology-mapping-a50d8d6.md)


> ### Note:  
> Integration Assessment uses key characteristics as a basis for questionnaires that guide you through the interface request process \(during the requirement analysis phase\).
> 
> A questionnaire is a set of questions that guide you step by step through an interface request.
