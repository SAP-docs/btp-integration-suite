# Migration Tooling

Understand how to consume the migration tooling and the steps involved in the migration.

Migration Tooling is a feature in the Cloud Integration capability of the SAP Integration Suite that helps you migrate integration objects from SAP Process Orchestration and SAP Process Integration to SAP Integration Suite.

> ### Note:  
> SAP recommends you to test your content after youâ€™ve migrated it. To do this, you can use regression test tools that have been made available for SAP customers by the partner companies. You can use these tools free of charge for a duration of 12 months. For more information, see [Elevate from SAP Process Orchestration and Modernize your integration platform with SAP Integration Suite](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/30/elevate-from-sap-process-orchestration-and-modernize-your-integration-platform-with-sap-integration-suite/) \(SAP Community blog\).
