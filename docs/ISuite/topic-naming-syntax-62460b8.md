# Topic Naming Syntax

Rules to be followed while naming a topic.

The following rules must be followed when naming a topic:

-   A topic name must be limited to 150 characters.

-   A topic name must contain at least two segments separated by a forward slash \( / \) as a segment separator.

    The segment separator must not appear at the beginning or ending.

-   A topic name can contain forward slash \( / \) only as segment separator.

-   A topic name can include these characters: alphanumeric, underscore \( \_ \), period \( . \), and hyphen \( - \).

-   A maximum of 20 segments can be used.

-   Empty segments are not allowed.

-   Use asterisk \( \* \) as a wildcard to represent a subtree of segments only at the end of the name.

-   Use plus \( + \) as a wildcard to represent a single segment with any content that is valid, but always the whole segment.
