## Authentication and Authorization



### Authentication

Users who access Event Mesh related features in SAP Integration Suite are authenticated against an identity provider. SAP Identity Service \(ID Service\) is used by default. SAP ID Service is the central service for the process of managing identities and their lifecycles.

User authentication is provided by the authentication methods supported by SAP BTP, which uses the Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) 2.0 protocol for both authentication and single sign-on.



### Authorization

Authorization for Event Mesh determines the level of access. Administrators generally authorize users with appropriate roles and role collections.

Integration Suite user interface

</td>
<td valign="top">

An integration developer or administrator of the Event Mesh capability accesses the Integration Suite user interface.
