During the provisioning process, the system will assign a default virtual host for you. You will receive a notification when the provisioning is complete. At this point, the *APIs* option will no longer be visible in the side-navigation menu under *Settings*. You will be logged out of SAP Integration Suite automatically. To continue, simply log in again. After logging in, you will have the ability to create APIs, build API proxies as a service provider, and utilize other convenient services offered by the platform.
