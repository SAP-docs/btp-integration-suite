## Prerequisites

-   To establish connections between the Developer Hub and SAP Integration Suite API Management tenants, a Cloud Foundry space should be created in the sub-account from where Developer Hub is hosted.

-   To establish a connection between an SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant and the centralised Developer Hub which is available in a different sub-account, you must ensure that the Developer Hub capability is not enabled in the same sub-account as that of the API portal.

-   The following role collections should be assigned to you:
    -   AuthGroup.API.Admin

    -   APIPortal.Administrator: To generate the access credentials from the SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant, you must have the *APIPortal. Administrator* role assigned to you.

    -   AuthGroup.APIPortalRegistration: You need this role to create a connection request and update the connection request credentials.

    -   APIPortal Service.CatalogIntegration: You need to have this role assigned to you as the client credentials is generated for this role.


-   Generate the access credentials to establish the connection.

    1.  Log on to SAP Integration Suite.

    2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Settings* \> *APIs*.

    3.  Choose the *Connection* tab.

    4.  Follow the onscreen instructions under **Connect the API Portal to the centralized Developer Hub** to generate the SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant access credentials.


    > ### Note:  
    > The client credentials get generated for the *APIPortal .Service.CatalogIntegration* role.

## Context

The Developer Hub administrator identifies which existing or new Developer Hub application can accept content from multiple SAP Integration Suite API Management tenants.

> ### Note:  
> Only new SAP Integration Suite subscriptions with API Management capability enabled with the SAP Integration Suite are allowed to set up a connection with the centralized Developer Hub.

> ### Note:  
> You can connect a maximum number of three SAP Integration Suite API portals to the centralized Developer Hub.

Create a new subaccount in Cloud Foundry and set up only the SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant.

For the newly set up SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant, you can request for the Developer Hub connection to be established.

> ### Note:  
> The option to disconnect an SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant from an existing Developer Hub isnâ€™t supported currently.

> ### Note:  
> Once this connection is set up, you can't place a request to severe this connection and establish a new connection with any other centralized Developer Hub.

## Results

You've submitted the connection request to the Developer Hub administrator. Once the connection request is approved by the administrator, you can start publishing the SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant content to Developer Hub.

> ### Note:  
> You can log on to the SAP Integration Suite API Management tenant and check the connection status. Navigate to *Settings* \> *APIs* and choose *Connection*.
> 
> You can also choose *Test Connection* to get the details about the connectivity status once your connection request is approved. You will get a connection error, if the destination is deleted or configured incorrectly. In case of an error, retry after revalidating the destination configuration.
