## Components

Edge Integration Cell runs on compute clusters managed by Kubernetes and consists of the following components:


<dl>
<dt><b>

Edge Lifecycle Management

</b></dt>
<dd>

Edge Lifecycle Management \(Edge LM\) is used as the foundation for software lifecycle management. It provides a shipment channel for SAP Business Technology Platform-based products to deliver and manage containerized workloads to on-premise or edge computing sites. It offers a convenient way to standardize the entire SAP Software Lifecycle for usage on the edge: Initial setup, onboarding, deployment, continuous lifecycle management operations, monitoring and logging – all via centrally offered tooling using modern software architecture and industry standards \(such as containers and K8s\) in an SAP environment.



</dd>
<dd>

Software shipment is based on the SAP Repository-Based Shipment Channel \(RBSC\). Edge LM also supports container image replication to a local container registry for offline consumption. Edge Integration Cell will be defined as an Edge LM solution with the different components based on Helm charts.

> ### Note:  
> Edge Integration Celll delivery consists of images retrieved from SAP Repository-Based Shipment Channel \(RBSC\), deployed using Edge LM. The images for Edge LM are also contained in the same repository.



</dd>
<dd>

Additionally, Edge LM offers an optional monitoring and logging stack to allow central system monitoring. This requires single sign-on using an Identity Authentication Service \(IAS\) tenant.

Runtime and Operations

</b></dt>
<dd>

In addition to runtime components for executing integration scenarios and API proxies, Edge Integration Cell also includes management components for edge operations.

Components require connectivity to certain SAP Integration Suite and SAP Business Technology Platform services. Service keys are used to share the connectivity information withEdge Integration Cell components. For security reason, these service keys also need to be rotated as part of the software upgrade. Depending on the service type, keys have different validity timelines.

Edge Deploy Controller accesses the platform’s object store where credentials have a validity of 86 days. In general, service keys need to be rotated after 120 days. Key rotation is integrated in Edge Integration Cell lifecycle operations.

> ### Caution:  
> If service key rotation is not performed then connectivity to the respective Cloud services stops working. This will impact functionality like content synchronization or specific runtime features.

Edge Local Authentication and Authorization provides inbound local authentication and authorization for Integration Flows and API proxies. It removes the real-time dependency on SAP Business Technology Platform for inbound authentication and authorization. Currently only ervice keys of type Certificate/External Certificate are supported for local authentication and authorization. For more information, see [Edge Local Authentication and Authorization](edge-local-authentication-and-authorization-510d447.md).
