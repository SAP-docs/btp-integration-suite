## Finish the Technology Selection for the Interface Request

In [Determine an Integration Technology](determine-an-integration-technology-69b6dae.md), you submitted an interface request, and its status changed from *Requirement Analysis* to *Technology Selection*.

1.  Go to your interface request, and on the summary page, choose *Select Technology*.

    The *Edit Results* page displays the following details for each technology.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Status
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Coverage*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Percentage of coverage of key characteristics in combination with other technologies selected.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Policy Rule*

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Policy-Based Recommendation*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Indicates to which degree this technology is recommended \(type of recommendation\):

    -   *General Recommendation*

    -   *Reasonable Alternative*
    -   *To be avoided*
    -   *Possible Exception*


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Application Policy*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Out of the multiple related Integration Policies that a technology can have, the calculation uses the one that is ranked the highest.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
2.  Review the details, select the technology and the instance, and choose *OK*.

3.  The list of proposed technologies is adapted to your settings.

    By choosing a technology, a screen opens showing to which extent the relevant key characteristics are covered by the technology.

    > ### Tip:  
    > To get an overview of all integration technologies and the supported integration styles, use case patterns, and key characteristics, go to *Analyze* \> *Integration Technologies Overview*.

4.  Choose *Submit*. The status of the request changes to *Completed*.

    To export the completed interface request as a PDF file, open the request and choose *Download*.

## Analyze Integration Patterns

To inspect the supported integration patterns, go to *Analyze* \> *Integration Patterns*.

The combinations of integration domain and integration style relevant for your organization are displayed.

Integration styles are indicated by a color code.

For each combination, a status is displayed:

****


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Status

</th>
<th valign="top">

Meaning

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Not Applicable

</td>
<td valign="top">

The combination can't be applied.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Not Assigned

</td>
<td valign="top">

Can be applied but not assigned for some business reason.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Applied

</td>
<td valign="top">

The combination is assigned.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

By selecting an integration pattern with the status *Not Assigned* or *Applied*, you can display the related integration technologies and \(if defined\) interface requests.

## Analyze and Edit Integration Policies

To inspect and edit the supported integration policies, go to *Analyze* \> *Integration Policies*.

You can define integration guidelines for your organization including default recommendations, reasonable alternatives, possible exceptions or techniques that you would like to avoid in your organization.

For each integration policy, the following attributes are displayed:

****


<table>
