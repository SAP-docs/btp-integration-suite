# API Management

The API Management capability in SAP Integration Suite is a complete solution, that addresses all enterprise requirements for API security and governance. It lets you publish, promote, and oversee APIs in a secure and scalable environment.

With API Management you can perform the following tasks:

-   **Proxify your APIs**: Create your own unified and harmonised API presence, using your own domain.

-   **Secure your APIs**: Secure your APIs against unauthorized access and threats. API management helps organizations define a standardized set of policies to protect APIs and the underlying backends.

-   **Perform Traffic Management**: Configure cache, and control traffic quotas and spikes, using the traffic management policies.

-   **Govern your APIs**: Discover and document all your APIs, manage the lifecycle of your APIs and govern them using the policies. Over 30 different policy types are available, ranging from traffic management and security policies.

-   **Get Business Insights**: Monitor with usage analytics, logs, events and triggers; use business insights to monetize your APIs.

-   **Transform your APIs**: Apply advance header and payload modifications.

-   **Developer Engagements**: Developer Hub is a feature-rich, themed, and customizable portal designed specifically for application developers. It provides comprehensive API documentation, code snippets, and more. With Developer Hub, developers can easily engage with the platform, enabling them to discover, subscribe to, and consume APIs directly.
