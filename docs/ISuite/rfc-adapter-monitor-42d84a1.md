# RFC Adapter Monitor

Monitor the underlying JCo entities of the integration flows deployed with the RFC adapter.

The *RFC Adapter* card shows four different entities, and the number of items associated with them:

-   *JCo Connections*
-   *JCo Servers*
-   *JCo Destinations*
-   *Metadata Repositories*

You can select any of these entities to navigate to a more detailed view.

Some entities may include navigation links. These links lead you to the detailed view of the entity where a filter is already applied. For example, you can select *Alive* on *JCo Server*, and the servers view opens, filtering for servers in the *Alive* state.

> ### Note:  
> The *RFC Adapter* card only displays information if there's at least one integration flow deployed on Edge Integration Cell using the RFC sender or receiver adapter. If there's no data to show, a message appears in the card, and you canâ€™t interact with it.

## JCo Connections

The *JCo Connections* view shows all the JCo connections \(client and server\) currently available in the system.

You can filter the list of connections to quickly locate specific information. Use *Adapt Filters* to choose which filters are displayed.

The overview table provides the following information:

<td valign="top">

This column is hidden by default but can be made visible via the table settings. It shows the current conversation ID, which may be empty for inactive server connections.

## JCo Servers

The *JCo Servers* view displays all JCo servers currently available in the system. Each RFC sender channel in the integration flow generates a JCo server object, which acts as an object that listens for incoming RFC calls. Typically, a JCo server holds one or more connections of the server type.

The overview table provides the following information:

</td>

<td valign="top">

</td>

</table>

Select any server to view more detailed information about it and see the list of corresponding JCo server connections. You can further drill-down into connection details by selecting a connection from the table.

## JCo Destinations

The *JCo Destination* view shows all the JCo destinations currently available in the system. These destinations issue outgoing RFC calls to the ABAP system. The RFC receiver adapter in the integration flow uses them to send messages via the RFC protocol to an ABAP system. Both adapters also use them to retrieve metadata from the ABAP system.

The overview table provides the following information:

****


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

<th valign="top">

<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> ### Note:  
> Some destinations might not have any connections. Once a client connection closes, it gets removed soon. If a destination doesn't have any connections, it gets removed shortly as well.

Select any destination to view more detailed information and see the list of corresponding JCo server connections. You can further drill-down into connection details by selecting a connection from the table.

## Metadata Repositories

The *Metadata Repository* detail view displays the number and types of currently cached objects. Both sender and receiver adapters use RFC metadata to transform messages from the native RFC format into XML format. The system stores RFC metadata internally in a cache. Each metadata repository corresponds to a connected ABAP system, and a JCo destination retrieves metadata from the system.

The overview table provides the following information:

****


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Parameter

</th>
<th valign="top">

Description

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*ID*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The identifier of the object. It usually corresponds to the SID of the connected ABAP system.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Pod*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The associated pod.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*JCo Destinations*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The number of JCo destinations. If several JCo destinations are configured per each metadata repository, it's non-deterministic which retrieves the data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Last Activity*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The last time this repository was active.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can select any repository to view more detailed information about the repository, the metadata cache, and the corresponding JCo destinations.

In the*Metadata Cache* section, you have the option to reset the cache of the selected repository. This is necessary when the structure definition changes in the original repository and isn't yet reflected in the cache. When you choose *Reset Cache*, you delete all cached metadata on all pods where the selected repository exists. On the next request, the system fetches metadata directly from the ABAP system and re-caches it.

> ### Note:  
> Resetting the cache requires administrative permissions, so only administrators can use this function.

You can further drill down into JCo destination details by selecting a destination from the table. From there, you can navigate to JCo connection and view the JCo connection details.
