# Migration Patterns

The migration patterns are used to migrate your objects from SAP Process Orchestration. In the first step, the integration scenario in the integration object is analysed and mapped to a corresponding pattern. Later, the steps involved in the integration object are dynamically created.

The migration tooling maps the sender and receiver channels from the source integration object to the equivalent supported ones in the SAP Integration Suite. The equivalent sender and receiver channels are populated in the new integration flow. Same is the case with the flow steps and events. If your integration object can be mapped to one of these patterns, then migration is achievable.
