# Trading Partner Management

SAP Trading Partner Management \(TPM\) is a powerful capability within SAP Integration Suite that streamlines the management and governance of business-to-business \(B2B\) relationships, agreements, and interactions with external trading partners. TPM empowers organizations to tailor their B2B data exchange to meet specific needs, defining and configuring electronic data interchange protocols, standards, and APIs for each trading partner.

With TPM, organizations can accommodate diverse B2B requirements, including:

-   Multiple communication protocols \(AS2, SFTP, FTP, etc.\)

-   Various B2B standards \(EDI, XML, JSON, etc.\)
-   APIs for seamless integration

The intuitive user interface simplifies the complexity of B2B communication, enabling efficient management of trading partner relationships, agreements, and data exchange configurations.

This application achieves the goal by using the entities and artifacts provided by the other capabilities of SAP Integration Suite such as:

-   SAP Integration Advisor

-   SAP Cloud Integration

## Features

The application helps you to:

-   Create and maintain trading partner profiles with their B2B requirements. This includes creating the profile of own company with all relevant information for setting up B2B scenarios such as contact person, identifiers, communication protocol and its parameters, and B2B standards.

-   Create communication partner profile to maintain all your AS2 specific configurations.
-   Develop templates for trading partner agreements based on the requirements of your B2B scenarios.
-   Create trading partner agreements using the templates and also including the requirements of the trading partners.
-   Push the auto-generated runtime artefacts of the B2B scenarios as defined in the agreements into the Partner Directory of SAP Cloud Integration. This will ensure that the B2B messages get processed individually by a single integration flow at runtime.
-   Deploy and run integration flows to conduct end-to-end business transactions.
