# What is SAP Integration Suite?

Simplify and accelerate enterprise integration. 

SAP Integration Suite is an industry-leading and enterprise-grade integration platform-as-a-service that helps businesses seamlessly connect and integrate their applications, data, and processes within their organization and beyond. A starter collection of pre-built, best-practice integration packs helps integration developers achieve faster time to value. Execute the integration content on the SAP Business Technology Platform or within your private landscape.
