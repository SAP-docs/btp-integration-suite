# Manage Keystore for Edge Integration Cell

A keystore is used to secure message exchange both at transport level and at message level.

## General Information

For Edge Integration Cell, you can have multiple keystores to separate the artifact assignment for the different runtimes.

For more general information on keystore functionalities, see [Keystore](40-RemoteSystems/keystore-b163513.md).

> ### Note:  
> For Edge Integration Cell, there are specific security artifact conditions in place. For more information, see [Copying Keystore Entries in Edge Integration Cell](copying-keystore-entries-in-edge-integration-cell-0800f7b.md)

> ### Note:  
> You can assign a runtime to one keystore only, but you can assign a keystore to several runtimes. If you assign only one runtime to an exiting keystore, this keystore is only available for this single runtime.
> 
> Remember:
> 
> -   The maximum size of a keystore assigned to an edge runtime is 1 MB.
> 
> -   The maximum number of keystores is limited to 20 per tenant.
> 
> -   You can assign up to 20 runtimes to a keystore.
> -   The maximum number of Edge Integration Cell instances is 20 per tenant.

> ### Caution:  
> To change the existing assignment of a keystore to a specific runtime, can cause message processing failures.

> ### Note:  
> Make sure to select the correct runtime by clicking on the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of your screen. Depending on the selected runtime, you get different viewing results and actions:
> 
> -   *All View*: Shows all keystores in a combined list. This view allows you to edit keystores by updating its runtimes, as well as to delete keystores. 
> 
> -   *Runtime-Specific View*: Shows your keystores associated with your specific runtime. This view allows you to remove keystores from runtimes.
>

> For more information, see: [Manage Security for Edge Integration Cell](manage-security-for-edge-integration-cell-1783cf8.md).

After you’ve specified the runtime view, check the details view list with the following information:


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Name*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Name of the keystore.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Entries*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Number of associated entries within the keystore.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Runtimes*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Number of runtimes associated with the keystore.

> ### Note:  
> Each runtime can only have one associated keystore; one keystore, however, can be associated with up to 20 runtimes.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Status*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Current status of the keystore. Click *Refresh* to update the status of each key store, for example, after you’ve made changes.

> ### Note:  
> If you have more than one runtime associated with one keystore, the overall status is an aggregated status that is a combined status of the individual associated runtimes.

Have a look at the following example:

If the status of **Runtime1** is *Deployed*, while the status of **Runtime2** is *Runtime Deactivated*, the aggregated status in the list shows *Runtime Deactivated*.

Click on the number displayed in the list to get a detailed view of your different runtimes.

The following statuses are possible:

-   *Deployed*: Keystore is up and running.

-   *Stored*: Keystore is deployed already but not yet synchronized with the associated runtime.

-   *Removal Initiated*: The process of removing the keystore from the runtime is in progress. 

-   *Deletion Initiated*: Deletion of the keystore has been initiated.

-   *Runtime Inactive*

-   *Error*
