A software solution \(SaaS or on-premise\) used in the integration landscape.

Deployment model

</td>

Identifies how the software is hosted, for example, in the public cloud or on-premise.

For example, the deployment mode *public cloud* applies when the software is provisioned to multiple customers for open use via the Internet.

Integration domain

</td>
<td valign="top">

Area in a hybrid landscape where integration is needed, for example, on-premise-to-cloud or cloud-to-cloud integration.

Identifying integration domains provides the entry point into SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology.

Integration domains are technology-agnostic and therefore help to create a blueprint for a hybrid integration platform consisting of multiple integration services and technologies \(SAP or non-SAP\).

You can do an assessment of your integration architecture by specifying the integration domains that are relevant for your organization or that you want to further evaluate.

See: [Integration Domains](integration-domains-e8360d2.md)

Integration Areas

</td>
<td valign="top">

A combination of integration domain and integration style.

You can do an assessment of your integration architecture by specifying the integration patterns that are relevant for your organization or that you might want to further evaluate.

Integration policy

</td>
<td valign="top">

Rule that describes how to use an integration technology in a dedicated context.

SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology foresees various levels of recommendation degrees that you can assign to integration technologies or services in your organization. This allows you to define integration guidelines for your organization, including default recommendations, reasonable alternatives, possible exceptions, or techniques that you would like to avoid in your organization.

For each integration technology, the supported integration domains are also indicated.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Integration style

</td>
<td valign="top">

Basic integration category or type, for example, process integration or the integration with things.

Integration styles are the key pillar of ISA-M. Each integration style has specific characteristics and can be refined with use case patterns. All integration styles are technology-agnostic and are applicable within multiple integration domains. You can do an assessment of your integration architecture by adding the integration styles that are relevant for your organization or that you like to evaluate further.

Integration use case pattern

</td>
<td valign="top">

Frequently found integration use cases in enterprise landscapes.

Integration use case patterns refine the integration styles identified for your organization's integration strategy.

You can do an assessment of your integration architecture by adding the integration use case patterns that are relevant for your organization or that you want to evaluate. You can also remove integration use case patterns that are not relevant in your organization.
