# Configuring Additional Virtual Host in Cloud Foundry Environment

A virtual host allows you to host multiple domain names on the API Management capability within SAP Integration Suite.

Create a new virtual host with default domain or custom domain and update alias, keystore, keyalias, and truststore for an existing virtual host in the Cloud Foundry environment.

> ### Note:  
> When updating the truststore or keystore during certificate renewal, ensure you also update the associated virtual host.
