If your objects contain components that aren't mentioned here, you would require additional effort for the migration. Hence, the migration of such integration scenarios isn't supported in the current scope.

Also, refer to the list of [Known Limitations of Migration Tooling](known-limitations-of-migration-tooling-7a552d4.md) before you get started with the migration.
