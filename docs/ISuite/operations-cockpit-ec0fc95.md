In the Operations Cockpit, you can get an overview over the most critical resources. To do so, select the Edge Integration Cell you want more information about from the dropdown option in the upper left corner of your screen.

After making your selection, the dashboard displays the most critical resources associated with your chosen Edge Integration Cell as tiles. These tiles provide the status of the resources, informing you about any critical errors or issues on your system. You can easily access and monitor each resource by choosing any of the following tiles:
