# Questionnaires



Questionnaires are related to key characteristics \(see [Key Characteristics](key-characteristics-c16258e.md)\).

The questionnaire contains questions about your integration requirements. The questions are oriented and structured along the defined key characteristics.

Questionnaires are the basis for the interface request process. They are based on either the ISA-M context or the functional scope.

By using configurable questionnaires, you can capture the interface requirements in a structured way. The system uses the results for intelligent technology recommendations.

> ### Example:  
> The following question predefined by SAP is related to the *Data Transformation* key characteristic:
> 
> *Which level of transformation \(of messages, interfaces, values\) does your integration scenario require for allowing the receiver to properly consume the data?*
> 
> The answer options *No Transformation*, *Simple Transformation* and *Advanced Transformation* correspond to related key characteristic values.
> 
> The *Type* is *Single Select* because the answer options do not allow for multiple selections.

Depending on the answers to all of the questions, the technology mapping determines the suitable integration technology.

> ### Note:  
> The SAP pre-defined questionnaires \(indicated as *Maintained by SAP*\) cannot be customized.
