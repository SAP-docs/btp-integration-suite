## Reporting an Incident

If you find an issue with Cloud Integration, you can report an incident or error through the [SAP Support Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.sap.com%2Fen%2Findex.html). For more information, see [Product Support](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.sap.com%2Fen%2Fmy-support%2Fproduct-support.html).

> ### Recommendation:  
> Use [SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/home) to automatically fetch the components based on your current selection and the page you are working on.

When you submit the incident, we recommend including the following information:

-   Landscape information \(Canary, EU10, US10\)

-   The URL of the page where the incident or error occurs

-   The steps or clicks used to replicate the error

-   Screen grabs, videos, or the code being inputted
