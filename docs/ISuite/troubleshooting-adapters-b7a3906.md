The HTTP Adapter does not support the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header in AJAX responses, hindering cross-origin resource sharing.

Multiple MPLs are generated for a single call to Cloud Integration

</td>
<td valign="top">

Review the HTTP access logs and MPLs to verify if multiple calls are reaching Cloud Integration, particularly at fixed intervals. This should be investigated on the client side. And also reduce the load to complete processing before a timeout occurs.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

javax.servlet.ServletException: Error during write of the response: causes java.io.IOException: Broken pipe

</td>
<td valign="top">

Investigate the reason for the client terminating the connection. Additionally, verify whether the client's timeout setting is shorter than the server's response processing time.

</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Server called with HTTP adapter do not support Transfer-Encoding header and expects content-length header

</td>
<td valign="top">

Perform the following:

1.  HTTP 1.1 permits both headers but prevents their use in the same request. The endpoint should ideally conform to this standard, as followed by the adapter.
2.  Use a Groovy script to convert the stream to a byte array or string to alter the body generator type. Ensure correct encoding to avoid potential issues.

Investigate which component takes more time in your integration flow. Further investigate tcp dump to find at which side the connection close request comes from.

Outbound calls work usually for the endpoint. However, with more frequent calls \(higher load\), a timeout or unavailability is observed as response to HTTP requests

</td>
<td valign="top">

Perform the following:

1.  Performance test to check if the server is resilient to the load.
2.  For further investigation, create a support ticket on the component **LOD-HCI-PI-OPS** or to the team **BC-NEO-IT-NW**.

Create a ticket with Cloud Integration so that the Network/Ops team can look into the issue. Alternatively, reduce the processing time.

When an outbound calls is made, HTTP receiver could not complete TLS negotiation inside stipulated connect timeout of 10000ms.

</td>
<td valign="top">

Perform the following:

1.  Check if the failures happen around the same time - 10 failures in 1 minute for one endpoint and then no issue during next 1 minute. This could be a server side issue.
2.  Are the failures happening for only on worker - that is, the issue is happening only in one worker and not a single failure for other workers. This could be a possible issue with Cloud Integration. Create a ticket with component **BC-NEO-IT-NW**.
3.  If the issue is happening only for one endpoint - that is, only integration flow with a specific endpoint fails and passes for all other endpoints. This could be a server side issue.
