Domain

</td>
<td valign="top">

Domain is an area in a hybrid landscape where integration is needed.

Identifying integration domains provides the entry point into SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology.

Style

</td>
<td valign="top">

Style is the basic integration category or type. Each integration style has specific characteristics and can be refined with use case patterns.

Use Case Pattern

</td>
<td valign="top">

Integration use-case patterns refine the integration styles identified for your organization's integration strategy.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Integration Pattern

</td>
<td valign="top">

To derive integration guidelines for complex landscapes, Integration patterns combine integration domains and integration styles to derive integration guidelines.

You can do an assessment of your integration architecture by adding the integration patterns that are relevant to your organization or that you might want to further evaluate.

Application

</td>
<td valign="top">

Application is a software solution \(SaaS or on-premise\) used in the integration landscape. Integration assessment differentiates between application profile, which indicates the software group, and application instance, which is the actual runtime component.

The maximum number of applications is 20000.

-   *Create*: The initial status of the request is `draft` \(set automatically\).
-   *Submit*: Changes the status to `new` \(updated by the user\).
-   *Assess Interface Requests*: The status shifts to `in progress` \(set automatically\).
-   *Complete*: Updates the status to `completed` \(updated by the user\).
-   *Reopen*: Switches the status back to `in progress` \(updated by the user\).
