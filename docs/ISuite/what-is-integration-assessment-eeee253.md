## Methodology

Integration Assessment uses SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology \(ISA-M\).

This methodology:

-   Helps you to create a representation of the integration reference architecture for your organization in a structured way.

-   Helps you to specify technology-agnostic aspects relevant for your organization's integration strategy \(such as, integration domains and integration styles\) and to map these aspects to the best suitable integration technologies.

-   Guides you through the interface request process and provides smart technology proposals for your organization's context.
