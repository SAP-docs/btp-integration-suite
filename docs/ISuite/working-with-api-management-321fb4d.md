The API lifecycle encompasses several stages, including API planning, creation, and implementation by company developers, API creators, and composers. It extends to the consumption of these APIs by other employees, partners, or users of the company's products and services. For more information, see [API Lifecycle](api-lifecycle-5e8ea7d.md).

Components of API Management

</td>
<td valign="top">

The API Management components collaborate to offer a comprehensive solution, allowing organizations to securely expose, manage, and monetize their APIs. This empowers developers to effectively build applications that utilize these APIs. It comprises of five key components: API Management Runtime, API Management Design Time, Developer Hub, API Analytics and API Designer. For more information, see [Components of API Management](components-of-api-management-e02ae53.md).

Important Concepts of API Management

</td>
<td valign="top">

The structure of the API Management capability within SAP Integration Suite revolves around APIs, products, applications, users, developers, and accounts. Understanding this structure is crucial for effectively managing and organizing APIs within API Management. For more information, see [Important Concepts of API Management](important-concepts-of-api-management-414808b.md).

Managing API Endpoints

</td>
<td valign="top">

The primary purpose of API Management is to manage your API endpoints. Managing API endpoints involves two categories:

-   Proxified API endpoints, which are the APIs that you explicitly want to "proxify" by routing API calls through an API proxy.

-   Unproxified API endpoints, also known as unmanaged or externally managed APIs, are endpoints that do not require an API proxy and are not part of the strictly managed APIs.

For more information, see [Managing API Endpoints](managing-api-endpoints-ac794e4.md).

Configure APIs

</td>
<td valign="top">

Create, update API proxies and register APIs. For more information, see [Configure APIs](configure-apis-fdf5373.md).

API Services

</td>
<td valign="top">

A variety of APIs are offered as services in specific use cases and workflows. You can explore them and try it out in the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. For more information, see [API Services](api-services-007d50f.md).

<td valign="top">

API Management Service Plans

</td>
<td valign="top">

The functionality of the API Management capability is typically managed using the SAP Integration Suite \(UI\) application. However, there are certain service plans that allows you to call API Management APIs, manage Cloud Foundry applications, and connect to an on-premise backend system. For more information, see [API Management Service Plans](api-management-service-plans-e064663.md).
