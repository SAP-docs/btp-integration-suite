</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Company Policy*

</td>
<td valign="top">

A set of rules designed to restrict what consumers a provider with a specific client ID can work with. Use company policies to restrict the consumers you and the users on your client can work with. This way, you can exclude unknown or malicious individuals and keep your assets safe. Company policies can be specific to a certain business partner numbers, an active membership, or a specific framework agreement, usage purpose, or contract reference.

SAP predelivers company policies, but you can also create your own company policies, specific to your use case.
