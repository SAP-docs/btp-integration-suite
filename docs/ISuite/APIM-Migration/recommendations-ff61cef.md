# Recommendations

This topic lists the recommendations that you must consider for migration.



-   After cloning the API Management content from the source to the target system for the first time, you must maintain both the systems, until you switch over from the source system to your target system completely.
-   It is recommended that you always add or modify your entities in the source system, and clone it to the target system by rerunning the tool as and when required, instead of adding them directly to the target system.
