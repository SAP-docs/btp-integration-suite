# Migrating API Management from Neo to the Multi-Cloud Foundation

Migrate the API Management content in Neo environment to a public cloud infrastructure \(hyperscalers\) within a multi-cloud foundation.



> ### Remember:  
> SAP Business Technology Platform, Neo environment will sunset on**December 31, 2028**, subject to terms of customer or partner contracts.
> 
> For more information, see SAP Note [3351844](https://me.sap.com/notes/3351844).

Migration Assistant for asset migration includes the tools and utilities that enable migration of design time assets nondisruptively from the Neo to multi-cloud foundation.

Your source system is the system that contains your API Management content in the Neo environment.

Your target system refers to the infrastructure that hosts your API Management content on a hyperscaler-managed infrastructure within a multi-cloud foundation. This multi-cloud foundation can either be your native standalone API Management subscription or the API Management capability within SAP Integration Suite.

For the migration assistance, you must have an SAP Integration Suite subscription with API Management capability enabled within SAP Integration Suite.

After completing the prerequisites mentioned in the steps below, you can clone your API Management artifacts nondisruptively from the source to the target system. Post cloning, you must complete some user actions and validate your target system.

> ### Note:  
> The developer portal is renamed to Developer Hub within the multi-cloud foundation. In this document Developer Hub is referred to as developer portal even within the multi-cloud foundation.
