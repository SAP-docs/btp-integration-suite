# Export and Import Content

With the export and import functionality on the *Content Management* page, you can manage your Integration Assessment data across tenants, ensuring seamless transfers and operational continuity. This tool is particularly useful for moving data from one tenant to another.

> ### Remember:  
> The export/import functionality is accessible only if you are on the current version of the content. If you're using an older version, you must update your content before using these features.

> ### Note:  
> You can only import or export the entire content set.

Available APIs can further assist in these operations. More information can be found in the [Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/ManagementAPI/overview).
