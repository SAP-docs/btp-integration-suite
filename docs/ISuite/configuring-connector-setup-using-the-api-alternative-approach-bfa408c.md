## Procedure

1.  First, create credentials to access Data Space Integration. The service instance and key your create in this step help you retrieve the connector URL for Data Space Integration.

    1.  Go to the SAP BTP cockpit and navigate to your subaccount that has SAP Integration Suite enabled. From there, go to *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* \> *Your space* \> *Services* \> *Instances*.

    2.  Select *Create* to create a new service instance and select `Data Space Integration API Access`. In the *Plan* field, enter `api`, and add an instance name. Then, choose *Next*.

    3.  Next, select the applicable roles to enforce user authorization. For this specific process, any role works, even `AuthGroup_DataspaceReadOnly`. For an overview of all roles, see [Personas and Roles](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fd99f220bba84308b411ea62c86ff31e/CLOUD/en-US/bb8cd79bd90e4b70ae424d7ff3f8c1e8.html "Get an overview of the personas and roles in Data Space Integration and the tasks they can accomplish.") :arrow_upper_right:.

        Once the roles are selected, select `client_credentials` as the grant type and choose *Next*.

    4.  Review the information and select *Create*.

    5.  Now, you need to create a service key for your service instance - either with ClientID/Secret or Certificate. For the service instance that was created, select *Create Service Key*. Enter a name for the service key and for the *Key Type* select `ClientID/Secret` or `Certificate`. Leave the rest of the fields as they are. Select *Create*.

        This service key contains the connector URL, which you'll need in the next step, so have it ready.


2.  You now need the URL of the Data Space Integration endpoint. You can find this information in the instance of the `Data Space Integration API Access` that you set up in a previous step.

    1.  Go to the SAP BTP cockpit and navigate to your subaccount that has SAP Integration Suite enabled. From there, go to *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* \> *Your space* \> *Services* \> *Instances*. Select `Data Space Integration API Access`.

    2.  A detail view opens. Click on the *More* icon \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> More\) and select *View*.

    3.  The credentials open. Copy the URL.


3.  To register your connector and connect to the data space, make the following POST call filled with your specific details:

    ```
    POST	/api/v1/dsi/registration
    						
    						{
    						"BPN": "<business partner number>",
    						"location": "<location code>",
    						"connectorName": "<name of the connector>",
    						"connectorUrl": "<URL of the connector>",
    						"connectorUserClientId": "<client ID of the offer management user>",
    						"connectorUserClientSecret": "<client secret of the offer management user>",
    						"centralIdpTokenUrl": "<central IDP token URL>",
    						"backendPortalUrl": "<backend portal URL>",
    						"bdrsServerUrl":"<BDRS server URL>",
    						"did":"<decentral identifier>",
    						"trustedIssuers":["<trusted issuers>"], 
    						"stsDimClientId": "<client ID of the identity wallet management user>",
    						"stsDimClientSecret": "<client secret of the identity wallet management user>",
    						"stsDimTokenUrl": "<IATP STS OAuth token URL>",
    						"stsDimUrl": "<IATP STS decentral identity management URL>"
    						}
    ```

4.  Now, register Cloud Integration using the Data Space Integration onboarding API.

    1.  For the next calls, you need the Data Space Integration connector URL. You've already performed parts of this procedure: Go to the SAP BTP cockpit and navigate to your subaccount that has SAP Integration Suite enabled. From there, go to *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* \> *Your space* \> *Services* \> *Instances*. Select `Data Space Integration API Access`. In the Details view, click the *More* icon \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span>\) and select *View*.

        > ### Note:  
        > Make sure that you're using the `Access Token URL`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` from the `Data Space Integration API Access (Plan API)` for the call.

    2.  The credentials open. Copy the URL, and save it for later.

    3.  In the Data Space Integration connector URL, call the following endpoint with the API parameters \(ciapi\) and runtime parameters \(cirt\) from the Cloud Integration service keys. To get these parameters, access the SAP BTP cockpit, go to *Instances and Subscriptions*, and open the details view of the service keys. See: [Preparing Cloud Integration](https://help.sap.com/viewer/fd99f220bba84308b411ea62c86ff31e/CLOUD/en-US/7014b7d65f2d479d9328d302e5ec0499.html "Data Space Integration interacts with Cloud Integration, so you must perform a few preparatory steps before you can get started with Data Space Integration.") :arrow_upper_right:.

        ```
        PUT	/api/v1/dsi/credentials/dataplane
        									
        									[     
        									{
        									"clientid": "<clientid>",
        									"clientsecret":"<clientsecret>",
        									"url": "<URL>",
        									"tokenurl": "<tokenurl>"
        									},
        									{
        									"clientid": "<clientid>",
        									"clientsecret": "<clientsecret>",
        									"url": "<URL>",
        									"tokenurl": "<tokenurl>"
        									}
        									]
        ```

        > ### Note:  
        > You can update the credentials you enter here anytime, for example, if they've been exposed or if they've expired after 12 months.


5.  Use the Data Space Integration connector URL to call the following endpoint:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > POST	/api/v1/dsi/dataplane
    > ```

    The provisioning of Data Space Integration can take up to 20 minutes. You can check the status by triggering a `GET` call to the following URL: `/api/v1/dsi/dataplane`.
