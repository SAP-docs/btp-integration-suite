# Developer Hub

Developer Hub is a web-based platform designed for developers to discover, explore, and utilize APIs offered by an organization.

To enable external application developers to consume APIs from different business systems, it is essential to publish these APIs. Publishing involves presenting the API proxies in a structured manner, essentially treating them as products. As an API administrator, you can accomplish this by creating a product in Integration Suite and then publishing it on Developer Hub. This allows you to expose one or more API proxies to application developers. Furthermore, content administrators on Developer Hub also have the ability to publish their APIs, complete with relevant documentation, to a catalog that developers can access.

Through this interface, developers can easily browse through the available APIs, access comprehensive documentation, and gain a clear understanding of how to effectively utilize them. They can also use the API testing console to make test calls to APIs and observe the corresponding responses.

In addition to its documentation and testing capabilities, Developer Hub incorporates features like self-registration, providing developers with the ability to create accounts and obtain API keys for accessing protected APIs. Furthermore, it offers functionalities for application management, including analytics and usage statistics.
