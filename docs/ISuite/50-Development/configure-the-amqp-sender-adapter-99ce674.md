# Configure the AMQP Sender Adapter

You use the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol \(AMQP\) sender adapter to consume messages in SAP Integration Suite from queues in an external message broker.



> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> Queues, topics, and messages can only be monitored by using tools provided by the message broker provider. Those monitors are not integrated into SAP Integration Suite . Using SAP Integration Suite , you can only monitor the integration flows using the AMQP adapter and the messages that are sent to or consumed from the message broker.

> ### Note:  
> To be able to connect to queues, you have to create queues and/or topics in the message broker. This needs to be done in the message broker, with the configuration tools provided by the message broker. In some messaging systems, you need to configure a *Lock Duration* to make sure that the message is not consumed more than once. This timeout must be longer than the expected processing time of the message, otherwise this would lead to duplicate messages.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.



Once you have created a sender channel and selected the AMQP sender adapter \(TCP or WebSocket\), you can configure the following attributes. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).



The following values are displayed in the *General* tab after a channel has been established. If you want to change the configurations, you need to configure a new channel.

Select the authentication method the message broker supports. *SASL* is selected by default.

-   *SASL*

    Select to use Simple Authentication and Security Layer \(SASL\).

-   *OAuth2 Client Credentials* \(only when *WebSocket* has been selected for *Transport Protocol* while creating the connection\)

    Select to use OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. At runtime, Cloud Integration gets access to the protected resources in two steps: After presenting a set of client credentials, Cloud Integration fetches an access token from a token service. In a subsequent step, Cloud Integration uses the access token to get access to the protected resources in the connected system.

    More information: [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant](../40-RemoteSystems/oauth-2-0-3823134.md#loio6316af5a7f2c4f3e870a997fd2d3e04e)

-   *Client Certificate* \(only when *TCP* has been selected for *Transport Protocol* while creating the connection and if *Internet* is selected for *Proxy Type*\)

    At runtime, Cloud Integration authenticates itself against the connected system using a client certificate.

    It's a prerequisite that the required key pair is installed and added to a keystore. This keystore has to be deployed on the related tenant. The receiver side has to be configured appropriately.

    > ### Note:  
    > This authentication option implies that Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) is used for the connection.

<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Max. Number of Prefechted Messages*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Enter the max. number of messages that may be prefechted by one worker. The allowed value range is 1 to 100.

The prefetch value is the number of messages that the sender adapter fetches in advance from the broker, and then gradually processes. The prefetch reduces the communication overhead and ensures that when a message has been processed, another is already there and is ready for processing.

If the integration flows that are triggered by the AMQP sender adapter run for longer than a few seconds, it makes sense to set a lower prefetch value. In particular, if the integration flow runs for more than a minute, you should consider setting the value to 1. You can expect then a performance deterioration in the two-digit millisecond range, per message. On the other hand, load balancing between several nodes works better even with short backlogs.

If you need to process a large number of messages with the integration flow, and the processing of the individual message only runs for a few milliseconds, it can be useful to increase the prefetch value.

> ### Note:  
> If you increase the value, this can lead to lock timeouts and the load balancing between the nodes deteriorates. In return, you can expect performance gains in the three-digit microsecond range, per message. For example, with a prefetch value of 100, 10000 messages process approximately a second or two faster.

*Max. Number of Retries* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Define the number of retries to be executed before a different delivery status is sent to the message broker.

Default value is set to `5`, maximum value is `99`.

> ### Note:  
> If this parameter is set to \(`0`\), any message that is marked as a retried message is directly returning the outcome configured in *Delivery Status After Max. Retries* to the message broker and does not even start processing the message. Be aware of the fact that any delivery attempt by the message broker, even a failed one \(for example, due to network issues\), increases the delivery counter of the message sent by the message broker.
> 
> If the value is set to a number bigger than `0`, the AMQP adapter returns the outcome configured in *Delivery Status After Max. Retries* to the message broker if the delivery count of the message exceeds the configured value. Otherwise, it processes the message and returns a released outcome in case of an error and an accepted outcome in case of a successful message processing.
> 
> The consequences of the provided outcome depend on the message broker and the queue configuration on the message broker. An accepted outcome usually removes the message from the queue. A released outcome usually triggers a redelivery. A rejected outcome may trigger a redelivery or move the message to a dead letter queue \(maybe only if the message was rejected for a configured number of times\). The same applies to a modified outcome with the undeliverable flag set, which also might transit the message on the message broker to some undeliverable state.
> 
> If the message broker is not configured properly, this behavior can lead to unwanted side effects. For example, the messaging system constantly re-sends the message, no other messages are being processed, and no additional message processing logs are written. As consequence, this can result in an unplanned high load of your tenant and message broker.



</td>
