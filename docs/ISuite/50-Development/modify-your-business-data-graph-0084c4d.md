## Results

After applying your changes, the business data graph will be reprocessed. Choose *Show Logs* to check that the status of your business data graph is set from *Updating* to *Available* after successful reprocessing.

> ### Note:  
> If an error occurs, the log shows the status *Available \(Update failed\)*. This status indicates that your new changes are not applied, and Graph kept your previous business data graph configuration.
