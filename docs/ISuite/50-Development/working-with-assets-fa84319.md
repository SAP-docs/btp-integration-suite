# Working with Assets

Learn about assets and how you can use them in a data space.



An asset is \(a set of\) data offered by a provider. See [Concepts in Data Space Integration](../concepts-in-data-space-integration-fcf96b2.md).

## Use Cases

Depending on your use case, you interact with assets in different ways:

-   As a **consumer**, you consume the assets either directly or in your business applications provided by other data space members according to their policies and the agreement you agreed to.

    See [Consuming Data Space Assets](../consuming-data-space-assets-5c0cdb8.md).

-   As a **provider**, your focus lies on creating and editing your own assets, preparing them for consumption by other data space members.

    See [Creating Assets](creating-assets-5e051be.md).
