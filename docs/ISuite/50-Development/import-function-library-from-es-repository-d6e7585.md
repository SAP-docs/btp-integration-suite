# Import Function Library from ES Repository



<a name="loiod6e758578666417e9c73a043315a9775__prereq_kjm_4zv_4xb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   [Configuring Connectivity to an SAP Process Orchestration System](IntegrationSettings/configuring-connectivity-to-an-sap-process-orchestration-system-8c36fd2.md)

-   [Creating a Function Libraries Artifact](creating-a-function-libraries-artifact-950b897.md)

## Context

There are certain limitations while importing and consuming the function library object:

-   The combination of the attributes `category` and `title` in a function library's method must be unique. No two methods within a function library class can have the same combination.

-   An imported function library object can be consumed in integration flows via message-mapping flow steps and message mapping artifacts. For other artifacts like REST API or OData service, you can consume only via message mapping artifacts; not via message-mapping flow steps.

-   You must maintain a function library object that contains custom Java code for any underlying Java version changes or platform dependencies changes.




## Procedure

1.  Open the Function Libraries that you created and choose *Edit*.

    The resource pane and editor comes up on the left and right sides respectively.

2.  In the resource pane, choose *Upload*.

3.  In the dialog box, choose *ES Repository* as the *Source*. You see the details populated in the *Name* and *Address* fields.

4.  Choose *Connect*.

    You see a list of available function library objects.

5.  Choose a function library object of your choice and choose *Select*.

    The selected function library object gets imported to the resource pane.

6.  Choose the imported object.

    A java class containing the user-defined functions as methods opens up in edit mode.

7.  Make necessary changes to the java class as per your requirement and choose *Save*.

    For example, if you want to change the execution type, find the `executionType` key and change its value. The supported values for execution type are: `SINGLE_VALUE`, `ALL_VALUES_OF_QUEUE`, and `ALL_VALUES_OF_CONTEXT`.

8.  Deploy the Function Libraries artifact before consumption.
