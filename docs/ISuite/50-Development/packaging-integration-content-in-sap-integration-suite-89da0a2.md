# Packaging Integration Content in SAP Integration Suite 

SAP Integration Suite allows you to assemble integration contents into packages so that integration developers can use these packages in their integration scenarios.

As an integration developer, you can now create integration packages for your specific domain or organization. You can also view different packages published by other integration developers and consume them for your integration purposes. You can modify these packages based on your requirements and upload them through the web application.
