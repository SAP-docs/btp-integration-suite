## Procedure

1.  Log on to the ******SAP Integration Suite**.

2.  From the left navigation pane, choose *Analyze*.

    The *Analytics* dashboard appears.

3.  Use the dropdown list on the top left to select one of the following views:

    -   *Performance View*: Displays performance-related charts and KPIs. For example, you can display a chart showing API traffic, or view performance-related KPIs such as total number of API hits, average response time for APIs, and so on.
    -   *Error View*: Displays error-related charts and KPIs. For example, you can display a chart showing the top 5 API policy-related errors, or view error-related KPIs such as total error count, total number of system errors, total number of API policy errors, and so on.
    -   *Custom View*: Displays custom charts that you've created by selecting measures, dimensions, and the chart type from the pane on the left.

4.  You can perform the following actions for every chart on the dashboard:

    -   **Details**: Navigate to the details page of any chart by choosing *Details* in the top-right corner of the chart. On the details page, you can switch between different chart types and apply filters.

    -   **Resize**: Change the size of the chart \(small, medium, or large\).

5.  If you want to analyze data for a selected period, choose the required time period at the top of the dashboard. You can view data for the following time periods:

    -   Last day
    -   Last 7 days
    -   Last 30 days
    -   Last 6 months
    -   Custom range \(date interval and frequency\) according to your requirements

    > ### Note:  
    > The data retention period in the analytics dashboard is 6 months. That is, the analytics dashboard stores and retains data only for a period of 6 months. After the retention period, the data is purged.

6.  If you want to customize an analysis using specific measures and dimensions, see [Customizing an Analysis](customizing-an-analysis-78bde6f.md)
