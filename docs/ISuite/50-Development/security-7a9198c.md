# Security

This highlights the security aspects of using Graph.

With the increasing use of distributed systems for managing business data, the demands on security are also on the rise. When using a new API, you need to be sure that it supports your business needs without allowing unauthorized access to critical information. User errors, negligence, or attempted manipulation of your system shouldnâ€™t result in loss of information or processing time. These demands on security apply likewise to Graph.

Graph's security is ensured by the security model of SAP BTP. The following are governed by SAP BTP security principles and services:

-   Tenants separation

-   Users

-   Identification

-   Role assignment

-   Authorization


The following table summarizes the main security features of Graph:

<td valign="top">

No access by unregistered applications to data exposed via Graph.

</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

Application blocking

</td>
<td valign="top">

Provide separate clients to different applications, which allows the revocation of access rights from rogue applications by invalidating the client ID or secrets, and without affecting others.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Credentials rotation

</td>
<td valign="top">

Limiting the lifespan of a client secret reduces the risk of secret-based attacks and exploits by limiting the period of time during which a compromised secret may be valid.

</td>
<td valign="top">

Every service key of the Graph instance has a different client secret.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Data privacy

</td>
<td valign="top">

Graph is entirely stateless and doesn't store, cache, or otherwise keep copies of any business data.

</td>
