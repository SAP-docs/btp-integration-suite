# Trading Partner Agreement

Explore and create trading partner agreements.

A Trading Partner Agreement \(TPA\) is a legally binding contract between two or more organizations that engage in business-to-business \(B2B\) transactions, outlining the terms, conditions, and guidelines for electronic data interchange \(EDI\), data synchronization, and other business transactions. The agreement establishes the rules, responsibilities, and expectations for the exchange of electronic documents, data, and other business information between trading partners.

The primary purpose of a Trading Partner Agreement is to:

-   Define the scope and terms of the business relationship

-   Ensure seamless communication and data exchange
-   Facilitate compliance with industry standards, regulations, and laws
-   Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and security of exchanged data

A typical agreement includes the following components:

-   **Partner Identification**: Names, addresses, and contact information of the trading partners.

-   **Transaction Types**: Definition of the types of transactions to be exchanged.
-   **Data Formats**: Specification of the data formats and standards to be used .
-   **Transmission Protocols**: Definition of the communication protocols and methods for data exchange.
-   **Security Requirements**: Specification of security measures to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
-   **Business Processes**: Description of the business processes and workflows to be followed.

Creating a Trading Partner Agreement is the last step in the design of a B2B transaction and is usually created out of a predefined template. There has been an update on the template format and, both the old and updated templates are available for creating an agreement. The procedure varies for both the templates and the corresponding steps are provided in the respective chapters.
