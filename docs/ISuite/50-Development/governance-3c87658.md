# Governance

Developer Hub offers integrated governance features that enable administrators to oversee and manage essential developer activities, including user registration and product subscriptions.

As a Developer Hub administrator \(with the *AuthGroup.API.Admin role* collection\), you can configure governance levels tailored to your organization’s requirements. These settings give you control over key areas such as:

-   **Access Governance**:
    -   **Site Visibility Governance**: Control the level of access of your Developer Hub catalog to the users. See [Manage Access](manage-access-9df3ece.md).
    -   **User Registration Governance**: Control developer access by ensuring administrator approval for registration within Developer Hub. See [Managing the Access Request of the Users](managing-the-access-request-of-the-users-8b79ee8.md).
    -   **Product Visibility Governance**: Control access to an API product using a custom role collection. See, [Restricting Access to API Products Using Custom Role Attribute](restricting-access-to-api-products-using-custom-role-attribute-09fb892.md).

-   **Subscription Governance**: Allow external administrators to manage product subscriptions outside of Developer Hub, using developer-specific keys as needed. See, [Manage Product Subscriptions](manage-product-subscriptions-452fcef.md).
