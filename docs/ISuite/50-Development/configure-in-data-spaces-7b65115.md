## About Company Policies

A **company policy** is a set of rules that defines the regulations for requesting and accepting an offer. As an admin, you create a set of allowed constraints that business partners might have used in their usage policy to offer their assets in the data space. This way, you can control which offers can be accepted by the users in your organization.

If a provider creates an offer that violates the rules set in the company policy, the offer is not shown to the users requesting the catalog. Note that the user must be assigned to the company policy with their client ID for the policy to apply.

Possible attributes for rules include business partner number, membership, framework agreement, usage purpose, and contract reference. For example, you can exclude offers with references to unknown contracts or usage purposes.

For more information and an example illustrating the behavior of company policies, see [Create and Edit Company Policies](create-and-edit-company-policies-51fa547.md).

SAP predelivers company policies, but you can also create your own company policies, specific to your use case.
