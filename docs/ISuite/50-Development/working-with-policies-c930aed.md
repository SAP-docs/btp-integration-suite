# Working with Policies

Learn about policies and how you can use with them in a data space.



A policy is a set of \(predefined\) rules for data access control defining access rights and duration of access based on the needs of the data owner. See [Concepts in Data Space Integration](../concepts-in-data-space-integration-fcf96b2.md)

## Use Cases

Depending on your use case, you interact with assets in different ways:

-   As a **consumer**, you encounter policies as part of a contract definition that regulates the way you can interact with assets offered by a provider. You can negotiate these contract agreements.

-   As a **provider**, you use policies to define the way in which consumers can use your assets.

    See [Creating Policies](creating-policies-91458cf.md) and [Editing Policies](editing-policies-5ea31f2.md).
