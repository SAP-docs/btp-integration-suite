# Adding an API Artifact

Add an API artifact to an package.



<a name="loioc2fe62c32855435f8b64e0fd10c8507e__prereq_qtk_13k_qwb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Enable Cloud Integration and API Management capabilities.

-   Provision Edge Integration Cell runtime.




## Context

You can design and deploy API artifacts along with Integration flows.

When you create an API artifact of the type REST and SOAP you can choose from the following options:

-   *URL*: Create an API artifact using the HTTP endpoint UR. For more information, see [Creating an API Artifact Using URL](creating-an-api-artifact-using-url-914f57e.md).

-   *Import*: Import an API definition and use it to build your API \(supported file types:.json, .yaml, and .zip\). For more information, see [Creating an API Using an Imported API Definition](creating-an-api-using-an-imported-api-definition-fb99a7d.md).

-   *API Specification*: Create an API artifact from a specification which contains the single target URL endpoint. For more information, see [Creating an API Using API Specification](creating-an-api-using-api-specification-39c2b30.md).

[Copying an API Artifact](copying-an-api-artifact-820c9e8.md "You may want to create a copy of an existing API artifact with all its configurations and policies intact. This can be useful when you want to create a similar API but with some modifications or variations. The copy feature allows you to quickly duplicate the API artifact and make the necessary changes without starting from scratch.You can create a duplicate of an API artifact by copying it within the same package or in a different integration package within the same SAP Integration Suite subscription.")
