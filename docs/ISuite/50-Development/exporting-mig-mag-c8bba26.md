<a name="loioc8bba26412d44253b734db432e736203__section_pyz_csc_4tb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Login to your application and choose Message Implementation Guidelines <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> or Mapping Guidelines:open_book: from the left pane.

2.  In the overview page, choose *Export*.

    This will display the list of MIGs or MAGs available for export. To view more details of a MIG/MAG, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> under the *Notes* column.

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Export* dialog also displays the number of MIGs and MAGs along with the number of versions available in the tenant. If you do a complete content move from one tenant to another, you can compare these numbers between the old and new tenant. This will help you verify if all MIGs and MAGs have been moved successfully without missing anything.

3.  Select the MIG/MAG that you want to export. You can also choose multiple entries fom the list.

    > ### Note:  
    > The maximum size limit allowed for exporting MIGs/MAGs is 500MB. Based on this size, an approximate number of MIGs/MAGs that can be selected per export is displayed on the *Export* dialog box. So, if you want to export all MIGs/MAGs, consider splitting them into multiple export files based on the number displayed.

4.  Use the filter option provided under each column header to search for a particular MIG/MAG.
5.  Choose *Export*. This will download the files in the `.zip` format.

1.  Select and open your MIG/MAG.

2.  Choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> and select *MAG Version \(ZIP\)*/*MIG Version \(ZIP\)* from the list.
3.  This will download only that specific version of MIG/MAG into a `.zip` file.
