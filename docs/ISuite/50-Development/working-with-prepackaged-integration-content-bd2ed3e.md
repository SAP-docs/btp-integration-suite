# Working with Prepackaged Integration Content

SAP delivers rich prepackaged integration content out of the box that enables you get started quickly. These integration packages are created for some of the commonly used integration scenarios. By using this content, you can easily get started with minimal integration developer effort:

1.  Choose *Discover* \> *Integrations* to find and explore the list of packages.

2.  Choose a package based on your requirements.

    -   In the *Overview* tab of the package, you can find detailed description about the package. You also find the *Support Information* that shows the correct support component for the package. The support component helps you report incidents to the right SAP support team when you face issues with the content of the package.

    -   In the *Artifacts* tab of the package, you can find artifacts like integration flows, value mappings, message mappings, documentation, and so on.


3.  Choose *Copy* to create a copy of the package to your design workspace that you can later edit, configure, and deploy.
