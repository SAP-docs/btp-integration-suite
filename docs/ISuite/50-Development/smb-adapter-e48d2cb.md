# SMB Adapter

In many integration scenarios, files must be exchanged between applications or systems via SMB servers. The SMB adapter allows connection to the SMB server to perform all the common CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, and Delete\) based operations for files and directories.

> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
