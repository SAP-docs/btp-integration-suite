# Invoke the API Endpoint URL via a REST Client

To access deployed API artifact, you need to invoke their endpoint URLs using supported authentication methods.

To invoke an API artifact, you can obtain credentials in two ways

-   **Via Process Integration Runtime**

    After deploying the API artifact, you can invoke the API endpoint using a REST client. For more information, see [Invoke an API Artifact by Obtaining API Credentials through Process Integration Runtime](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6afa6d14ff6d4006b5614676722ef006/CLOUD/en-US/b63baa26290948e68fedabc10b35f33d.html "To invoke an API artifact via a REST client, you'll need authentication credentials, which are generated by creating a Process Integration Runtime instance.") :arrow_upper_right:.

-   **Via Developer Hub**

    When accessing APIs secured with an authentication policy through the Developer Hub, the system generates a client ID and client secret. Use these credentials to obtain an OAuth token, which is required to call the API. For more information, see [Invoke an API Artifact by Obtaining Credentials via Developer Hub](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6afa6d14ff6d4006b5614676722ef006/CLOUD/en-US/e79810fc92d64c60981cef394c219fb8.html "To invoke an API artifact, you need to obtain the credentials from the subscription for application you created when subscribing to a product in Developer Hub.") :arrow_upper_right:.
