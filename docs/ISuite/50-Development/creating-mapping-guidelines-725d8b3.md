# Creating Mapping Guidelines

Before you create a new mapping guideline \(MAG\), you need to decide on the mapping method that you want to use.

In Integration Advisor, there are two types of mapping guidelines, based on the mapping method:

-   For **graphical mapping guidelines**, you create mappings graphically, namely by dragging source nodes towards target nodes in the mapping editor.

    Additionally, there are two types of graphical mapping guidelines: **standard** and **overlay**. See [Creating Standard Graphical Mapping Guidelines](creating-standard-graphical-mapping-guidelines-a42920e.md) and [Creating Overlay Graphical Mapping Guidelines](creating-overlay-graphical-mapping-guidelines-3e550b1.md).

-   For **XSLT mapping guidelines**, you create mappings by uploading an XSLT file that defines the mapping of the source and target nodes. See [Creating XSLT Mapping Guidelines](creating-xslt-mapping-guidelines-5f0518a.md).
