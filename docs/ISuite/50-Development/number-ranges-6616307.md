# Number Ranges

Create an alias for the number range.



## Context

While sending out a document in case of EDI processing, a unique interchange number must be added to each document. In order to add such an interchange number you can use the Number Ranges. The *Number Ranges* tab allows you to create an alias for the existing number ranges created in the *Monitor* tab. To know how to create and define number ranges, see [Managing Number Ranges](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/managing-number-ranges).

To create an alias for the number range, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the *Number Ranges* tab.

2.  Choose *Add*.

3.  In the resulting dialog, select a number range from the list for the *Number Ranges* field.

    > ### Note:  
    > The field displays the number ranges that are created in the *Monitor* tab for integrations. To know more, see [Managing Number Ranges](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/managing-number-ranges).

4.  Enter an alias name for the number range in the *Name* field and choose *Save*.

    You have now successfully created a trading partner profile and you can view the partner details under the *Trading Partners* tab. You can also view the administrative information under the tab.
