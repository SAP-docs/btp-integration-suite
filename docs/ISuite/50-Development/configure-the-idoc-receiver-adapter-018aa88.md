# Configure the IDoc Receiver Adapter

The IDoc receiver adapter enables SAP Integration Suite to send Intermediate Document \(IDoc\) messages to a receiver.

> ### Remember:  
> This component or some of its features might not be available in the Cloud Foundry environment. For more information on the limitations, see SAP Note [2752867](https://me.sap.com/notes/2752867).

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

## Supported Headers

-   SOAPAction Header

    This header is part of the Web service specification.


The IDoc receiver adapter sends a request and gets an XML response. This response is standardized. It has the same structure for all IDocs, with the exception of the type.

The following specific headers are set by the IDoc receiver adapter.

-   SapIDocType

-   SapIDocTransferId

-   SapIDocDbId

-   SapMessageId

## Configuring the Adapter

Once you have created a receiver channel and selected the IDoc adapter, you can configure the following attributes.

The *General* tab shows general information such as the adapter type, its direction \(sender or receiver\), the transport protocol, and the message protocol.

**Connection**


<table>
<tr>

<th valign="top">

Description

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Address*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Endpoint address on which Cloud Integration posts the outbound message, for example `http://<host>:<port>/payment`.

You can dynamically configure this field by entering an expression such like `${header.a}` or `${property.a}`, depending on whether you like to use a header or an Exchange property for dynamic configuration.

If you do that, at runtime the value of \(header or exchange property\)`a`, as contained in the incoming message, will be written into the Camel header `CamelDestinationOverrideUrl` and will be used to send the message to.

Also in case the `CamelDestinationOverrideUrl` header has been set by another process step \(for example, a Content Modifier\), its value will be overwritten.

The endpoint URL that is actually used at runtime is displayed in the message processing log \(MPL\) in the message monitoring application \(MPL property `RealDestinationUrl`\). Note that you can manually configure the endpoint URL using the *Address* attribute of the adapter. However, there are several ways to dynamically override the value of this attribute \(for example, by using the Camel header `CamelHttpUri`\).

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Proxy Type* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

The type of proxy that you are using to connect to the target system:

-   Select *Internet* if you are connecting to a cloud system.

-   Select *On-Premise* if you are connecting to an on-premise system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you select the *On-Premise* option, the following restrictions apply to other parameter values:
    > 
    > -   Use HTTP instead of HTTPS when specifying the virtual system url in the *Address* field.
    > 
    > -   Do not use the option *Client Certificate* for the *Authentication* parameter, as it leads to errors when performing consistency checks or during deployment.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you select the *On-Premise* option and use the SAP Cloud Connector to connect to your on-premise system, the *Address* field of the adapter references a virtual address, which has to be configured in the SAP Cloud Connector settings.

-   If you select *Manual*, you can manually specify *Proxy Host* and *Proxy Port* \(using the corresponding entry fields\).

    This option is only available if you have chosen a *Process Orchestration* product profile.

*IDoc Content Type*

</td>
<td valign="top">

There are the following options:

-   *Application/x-sap.idoc*

    -   Allows only single IDoc record for each request.

        Using this content type, composite IDoc messages aren’t supported. To set up scenarios with composite messages, use content type *Text/XML*.

    -   Enables message sequencing.

    -   Enables Exactly-Once processing.

        > ### Note:  
        > The IDoc adapter uses the header `SapMessageId` within the integration flow processing. If header `SapMessageId` isn't defined, the IDoc receiver adapter automatically generates a unique ID. This may lead to duplicates in situations where an already delivered message is retried. If however the header `SapMessageId` is set, the IDoc receiver adapter reuses its value. For `Exactly-Once` processing in the backend, you need to ensure that the header `SapMessageId` remains the same in case that the message is retried.
        > 
        > See: [Quality of Service Exactly Once](quality-of-service-exactly-once-f96cf27.md)


-   *Text/XML*

    Allows multiple IDoc records for each request.

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can set up composite IDoc messages using an *Aggregator* step \(see [Define Aggregator](define-aggregator-aa23816.md)\).
    > 
    > If composite messages are processed, the the headers `SapIDocTransferId` and `SapIDocDbId` of the response contain the ID of the first IDoc only.
    > 
    > You can read all IDs from the response payload or alternatively from header `SapIDocAssignMap`.

    > ### Note:  
    > Using this content type, Exactly-Once processing isn’t supported. To set up scenarios with Exactly-Once processing, use content type *Application/x-sap.idoc*.

*Authentication* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can select one of the following authentication methods:

-   *Basic*

    The tenant authenticates itself against the receiver using user credentials \(user name and password\).

    It is a prerequisite that user credentials are specified in a *User Credentials* artifact and deployed on the related tenant. Enter the name of this artifact in the *Credential Name* field of the adapter.

-   *Client Certificate*

    The tenant authenticates itself against the receiver using a client certificate.

    This option is only available if you have selected *Internet* for the *Proxy Type* parameter.

    It is a prerequisite that the required key pair is installed and added to a keystore. This keystore has to be deployed on the related tenant. The receiver side has to be configured appropriately.

-   *None*
-   *Principal Propagation*

    The tenant authenticates itself against the receiver by forwarding the principal of the inbound user to the cloud connector, and from there to the back end of the relevant on-premise system.

    > ### Remember:  
    > When you want to use Principal Propagation as the authentication method to connect with an on-premise system, don't pass any authorization headers. Follow the approach recommended by SAP BTP Connectivity. See: [Authentication to the On-Premise System](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/67b0b94f09f2446598787eea0855e56b.html).

    > ### Note:  
    > This authentication method can only be used with the following sender adapters: HTTP, SOAP, IDoc, AS2.

    > ### Note:  
    > Note that the token for principal propagation expires after 30 minutes.
    > 
    > If it takes longer than 30 minutes to process the data between the sender and receiver channel, the token for principal propagation expires, which leads to errors in message processing.


> ### Note:  
> You can externalize all attributes related to the configuration of the authentication option. This includes the attributes with which you specify the authentication option as such, as well as all attributes with which you specify further security artifacts that are required for any configurable authentication option \(*Private Key Alias* or *Credential Name*\).
> 
> Apply **one** of the following recommendations when externalizing such attributes.
> 
> -   Externalize **all attributes** related to the configuration of all options, for example, *Authentication* and *Credential Name* and *Private Key Alias*.
> 
> -   Externalize only one of the following attributes: *Private Key Alias* **or** *Credential Name*.
> 
> 
> **Avoid incomplete externalization**, for example, only externalizing the attribute for the *Authentication* parameter but not the related *Credential Name* parameter. In such cases, the integration flow configuration \(based on the externalized parameters\) cannot work properly.
> 
> The reason for this is the following: If you have externalized the *Authentication* parameter and only the *Private Key Alias* parameter \(but not *Credential Name*\), all authentication options in the integration flow configuration dialog \(*Basic*, *Client Certificate*, and *None*\) are selectable in a dropdown list. However, if you now select *Basic* from the dropdown list, no *Credential Name* can be configured.

*SAP Message ID Determination*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Select this option to specify how a target message ID \(referred to as SAP message ID\) shall be defined.

> ### Note:  
> You can use this feature to implement scenarios that guarantee end-to-end Exactly Once delivery. A receiver can use the target message ID, for example, to make sure that the receiver can process a certain message only once.
> 
> See: [Special Use Cases: SAP RM vs XI vs IDoc](special-use-cases-sap-rm-vs-xi-vs-idoc-5f7fa93.md)

You can choose among the following options:

-   *Generate* 

    Generates a new SAP message ID.

-   *Reuse* \(default\)

    Take over the message ID passed with the header `SapMessageId`. If the header is not available in runtime, a new message ID is generated.

-   *Map*

    Maps a source message ID to the new target message ID.

    This option generates a target message ID that is uniquely associated with the source message ID specified with parameter *Source for SAP Message ID*. Precisely spoken, the system sets the value of header `SapMessageId` to a globally unique identifier \(GUID\). This GUID identifies the target message.

    To specify the source message ID, you can use a header or a property. If no header or property is specified, the system generates a source message ID.


Note that source-to-target message ID mapping entries are deleted after 90 days. Furthermore, only the first 120 characters from the source message ID are considered by the mapping.

> ### Tip:  
> As example, let’s assume that you’ve chosen option *Map* for parameter *SAP Message ID Determination*, and in field *Source for SAP Message ID* you entered `${property.orderNo}`.
> 
> Furthermore, let’s assume that at runtime the property `orderNo` has the value `00001`. The IDoc receiver adapter generates a unique identifier \(GUID\) for the target message ID, for example, `12a900b1-08ab-4812-x3ff-4y375b25z290`. In the scenario, the receiver system can then associate the target message ID `12a900b1-08ab-4812-x3ff-4y375b25z290` with the source message ID `00001`.
