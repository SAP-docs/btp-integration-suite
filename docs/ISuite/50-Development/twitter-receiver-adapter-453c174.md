# Twitter Receiver Adapter

You use the Twitter receiver adapter to extract information from the Twitter platform based on certain criteria such as keywords, user data, for example. As one example, you can use this feature to send, search for and receive Twitter feeds.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

The connection works that way that the tenant logs on to Twitter based on an OAuth authentication mechnism and searches for information based on criteria as configured in the adapter at design time. OAuth allows the tenant to access someone else’s resources \(of a specific Twitter user\) on behalf of the tenant. As illustrated in the figure, the tenant \(through the Twitter receiver adapter\) calls the Twitter API to access resources of a specific Twitter user. Currently, the Twitter adapter can only be used as receiver adapter. For more information on the Twitter API, go to: [https://dev.twitter.com/](https://dev.twitter.com/).

The authorization is based on shared secret technology. This method relies on the fact that all parties of a communication share a piece of data that is known only to the parties involved. Using OAuth in the context of this adapter, the Consumer \(that calls the API of the receiver platform on behalf of a specific user of this platform\) identifies itself using its **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**, while the context to the user itself is defined by an **Access Token** and an **Access Token Secret**. These artifacts are to be generated for the receiver platform app \(consumer\) and should be configured that way that they will never expire. This adapter only supports consumer key/secret and access token key/secret artifacts that do not expire.

To finish the configuration of a scenario using this adapter, the generated consumer key/secret and access token key/secret artifacts are to be deployed as Secure Parameter artifact on the related tenant. To do this, use the Integration Operations feature, position the cursor on the tenant and chosen *Deploy Artifact*. As artifact type, choose *Secure Parameter*.
