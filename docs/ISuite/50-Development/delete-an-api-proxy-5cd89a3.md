# Delete an API Proxy

To delete an API proxy, you must disassociate the API from the product or delete the product it is associated to.



## Context

In this section, we have described how to delete the API proxy after disassociating it from the product. Alternatively, you can delete the product and then delete the API proxy. However, to delete the product, you must disassociate the product from all the applications where it is being used.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the Integration Suite.

2.  Choose the navigation icon on the left and choose *Configure* \> *APIs*.

3.  Choose the API you want to delete.

    The *View API* page is displayed.

4.  Scroll down to the *Products Associated* section, and choose the product.

    You are redirected to the *View Product* page.

5.  Navigate to the *APIs* tab and choose *Edit*.

6.  To disassociate the API from the product, select the checkbox next to the API and choose *Remove*.

    Provide your confirmation by selecting *Yes* on the *Remove API* dialog.

7.  Navigate back to the *Configure* \> *APIs* page and search for the API you removed from the product.

8.  To delete the API, choose the <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> Action icon and choose *Delete*.
