You can visualize the adapter endpoints in the *Manage Integration Content* section.

With the new release of integration service, the endpoint definitions of some adapters are extracted.

Go to *Manage Integration Content* and select an integration flow from the list and go to *Endpoints* in the detailed view.

You can visualize the endpoint URL and the definition as specified in the following table, copy the URL to the clipboard or download the definition:

    > ### Caution:  
    > In case you want to download the WSDL in Cloud Foundry via a technical client, you need a service instance of the plan `api` assigned with the`MonitoringDataRead` role. It is not possible to use a service instance of plan `integration flow`.
    > 
    > See: [Creating Service Instance and Service Key for Inbound Authentication](../40-RemoteSystems/creating-service-instance-and-service-key-for-inbound-authentication-19af5e2.md) and [Tasks and Permissions for Cloud Integration](../60-Security/tasks-and-permissions-for-cloud-integration-556d557.md).

-   *WSDL Policies*

    There are two options to download the WSDL: with or without policies. The WSDL with policies includes WS-policy assertions defining special requirements the sender system must adhere to. If the sender system doesn't understand WSDLs with policies, the WSDL without policies can be used instead.
