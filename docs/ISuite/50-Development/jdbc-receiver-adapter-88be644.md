# JDBC Receiver Adapter

The JDBC \(Java Database Connectivity\) adapter enables you to connect SAP Integration Suite to cloud or on-premise databases.

Use the JDBC receiver adapter in your integration flow to establish a connection with SAP-managed and third-party databases. Before deploying the integration flow, you’re required to do the following to establish connection with the database:

-   Your tenant administrator has uploaded and deployed JDBC drivers. For more information, see [Configure JDBC Drivers](configure-jdbc-drivers-77c7d95.md).

-   Create a Data Source, to access the database, based on the uploaded JDBC driver. For more information, see [Managing JDBC Data Sources](managing-jdbc-data-sources-4c873fa.md).

-   If you're connecting to on-premise database, then you must validate the connection in the Cloud Connector. For more information, see [Configure Access Control](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/f42fe4471d6a4a5fb09b7f3bb83c66a4.html).

-   Configure the JDBC adapter to communicate with your database based on the environment that hosts your tenant.


> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

The JDBC receiver adapter uses XML SQL Format message protocol. The adapter performs operations such as read, write, update, or delete database entries. For more information on modifying or structuring the content of the message payload, see [Defining XML Documents for Message Protocol XML SQL Format](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5cf7d2de571a45cc81f91261668b7361/7.5.4/en-US/2e96fd3f2d14e869e10000000a155106.html).

> ### Note:  
> -   Currently, only TCP connections are supported.
> -   Deploy the public certificate in the keystore of your Cloud Integration tenant for verifying the response.
> 
> -   While executing direct SQL queries, it’s recommended to use standard stored procedure method to read XML files.
> 
> -   Standard PI XML format is supported. But the PI XML doesn’t allow function calls to PostgreSQL server.

## Supported Databases

The following are the databases that are currently supported.

> ### Note:  
> If you like to use the JDBC adapter to process integration scenarios in a Edge Integration Cell runtime, choose any database from the below list that is reachable for your Edge Integration Cell node.

-   [DB2](jdbc-for-db2-on-premise-9515cf8.md)
-   [Microsoft SQL Server \(Cloud\)](jdbc-for-microsoft-sql-server-cloud-4173d0a.md)
-   [Microsoft SQL Server \(On-Premise\)](jdbc-for-microsoft-sql-server-on-premise-9745e40.md)
-   [Oracle \(Cloud\)](jdbc-for-oracle-cloud-f868182.md)

## Using the JDBC Adapter, Cloud Foundry Environment

You’ve a Cloud Integration tenant hosted on a Cloud Foundry or multi-cloud environment that needs access to the on-premise \(SQL server\) or cloud databases provided "as-a-service" managed by third-party vendors.

By configuring the JDBC adapter you can connect to these databases. In addition, the adapter supports connection to a relational database type that provides an easy access point to connect with another databases. Use Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) for accessing and managing the following databases:

-   PostgreSQL

-   Microsoft SQL

-   Oracle


> ### Note:  
> SAP-managed databases such as HANA and ASE aren’t supported in a multi-cloud environment. As an alternative, you can connect with SAP HANA Cloud database supported by AWS tenants hosted in the Cloud Foundry environment.

The following diagram shows the supported the databases for Cloud Integration..

## Connection



### 

After adding the JDBC receiver adapter step in your integration flow, set up the connection based on the description mentioned in the table:

**Configure the Connection Details as Per the Description**

*JDBC Data Source Alias*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Enter the name of the data source, which is created to establish the connection to your preferred database. For more information, see [Managing JDBC Data Sources](managing-jdbc-data-sources-4c873fa.md).

> ### Note:  
> -   Deployment of JDBC Data Source fails if you have heterogeneous cluster setup, that is the cluster setup must be configured with the same runtime profiles. Combination of different runtime profiles aren’t supported.
> 
> -   You can use the same JDBC Data Source in different integration flows configured with JDBC adapter. But you can’t use the same JDBC Data Source to configure multiple JDBC adapters within an integration flow. You need to deploy two JDBC Data Source artifacts with different names for the same database and use them in the integrations flows having multiple JDBC adapters.
