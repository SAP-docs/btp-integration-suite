## Procedure

1.  Enter a meaningful name in the *Action Name* field.

2.  Provide a description in the *Description* field and choose *Create*.

3.  In the *Select Mapping Guideline Versions* step, you need to choose the MAG for which the version detail has to be updated. Under *Current MAG Version* section, select the current MAG using the value help <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‡³</span> for the *Current MAG* field.

4.  The value help provides you with the following filter options to use and find your MAG:

    -   Name

    -   MAG Version
    -   Status

    Set the necessary filters and choose *Go*.

5.  Select a MAG from the filtered result and choose *Select*.

6.  Now, select the version from the drop-down list provided next to the MAG name.

7.  The *MAG Version* field under the *Target MAG Version* section gets auto-filled with the MAG name you chose in Step 5. You need to now choose the target MAG version from the drop-down list.

8.  There could be scenarios where target MAG version and the source MAG version might contain different version of MIG references. In such cases, if you want to also update the source MIG references with the target MIG references, choose *Include MIG Versions Update* radio button. Or choose *Skip MIG Versions Update* to skip updating the MIG references.

9.  Choose *Next*.

10. In the *Agreements* step, you need to select the agreements to get their business transactions updated with the target MAG version. Select the checkbox of the field *Update MAG information in source templates* if you want to update the MAG information in the corresponding agreement templates.
