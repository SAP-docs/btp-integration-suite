# Configure Receiver Channel with ebMS3 Push

Configure the AS4 receiver channel as a sending Message Service Handler \(MSH\) to send business documents.



<a name="loio449f6e94db044b44864a4878c08237d5__prereq_cdl_kdg_tdb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You must deploy the private key pair in theCloud Integration keystore for signing the AS4 message.

-   You must have configured an integration flow in the editor. For more information, see [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).




## Context

Use the *ebMS3 Push* message protocol to transmit AS4 message.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.
