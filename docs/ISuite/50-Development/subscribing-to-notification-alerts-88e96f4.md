> ### Note:  
> The availability of the anomaly detection feature is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://me.sap.com/notes/2903776) and [3463620](https://me.sap.com/notes/3463620).

Subscribe to the **SAP Alert Notification Service** and start receiving automated alerts for anomaly detection.
