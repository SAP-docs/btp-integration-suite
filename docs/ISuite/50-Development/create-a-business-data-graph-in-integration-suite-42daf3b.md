## Prerequisites

You have:

-   Assigned the role of Graph Key User.

    You need this role to use the configuration tool.

-   Set up your data sources and provided your user with authorization to access all the data sources \(destinations\) in the landscape.

    Your user needs this authorization to allow Graph to discover the data models.
