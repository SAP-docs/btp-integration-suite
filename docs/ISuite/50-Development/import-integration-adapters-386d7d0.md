# Import Integration Adapters

Import to your design workspace and auto-deploy the adapters that are available on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.



## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Flow Editor, do one of the following based on your requirement:

    1.  Choose *Sender*, select the connector, and drag to *Start*.

    2.  Choose *End*, select the connector, and drag to *Receiver*.


2.  In the *Adapter Type* dialog, select the adapter that you want to assign.

    You see a list that includes both preshipped adapters and the ones from SAP Business Accelerator Hub. Though you haven't imported adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub, Cloud Integration shows you all the adapters that are available from the Hub.

    After you select an adapter hosted on SAP Business Accelerator Hub, Cloud Integration automatically imports the adapter and its package to your design workspace, and automatically deploys the adapter to the runtime profile configured for the integration flow.

3.  Save or deploy your changes after configuring the adapter. See: [Configure Adapter in Communication Channels](configure-adapter-in-communication-channels-1f06633.md).
