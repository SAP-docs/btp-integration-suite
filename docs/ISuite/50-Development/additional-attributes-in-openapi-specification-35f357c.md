# Additional Attributes in OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI Specification allows you to define additional attributes or custom extensions that start with `x-`, such as `x-sap-api-type`.

You can use an OpenAPI Specification to describe extra functionality of the API that is not covered by the standard OpenAPI Specification.

. To know more about these additional attributes, see:
