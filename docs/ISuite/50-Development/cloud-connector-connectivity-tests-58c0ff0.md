# Cloud Connector Connectivity Tests

When you have chosen the Cloud Connector, the test tool checks whether the Cloud Connector has been configured and can be reached.

> ### Remember:  
> This component or some of its features might not be available in the Cloud Foundry environment. For more information on the limitations, see SAP Note [2752867](https://me.sap.com/notes/2752867).

To use the Cloud Connector, you must have installed and configured it as described in [Outbound: SAP Cloud Connector](../40-RemoteSystems/outbound-sap-cloud-connector-642e87f.md) 

To perform the connectivity test for the Cloud Connector enter a *Location ID* and choose *Send*.

> ### Note:  
> The location ID identifies a specific Cloud Connector and is unique per subaccount. A cloud connector with an *empty* location ID can also exist.

If the system could not connect to the cloud connector, check the configuration and whether the location ID exists.
