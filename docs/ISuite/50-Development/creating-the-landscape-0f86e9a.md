# Creating the Landscape

A Graph landscape is represented by an SAP BTP subaccount.

This is the context in which authentication and security access to Graph are established, business systems \(data sources\) are connected, and business data graphs are created and activated in the SAP Integration Suite. Commercially, an SAP BTP subaccount is also where data usage is registered.

For more information, see [Authentication](authentication-79aabda.md) in the [Develop](develop-93b23df.md).
