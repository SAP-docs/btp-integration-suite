# Define General Splitter



## Context

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

The *General Splitter* splits a composite message comprising N messages into N individual messages, each containing 1 message with the enveloping elements of the composite message. The term *enveloping elements* refers to these elements including the split point. Note elements that follow the one that is indicated as split point in the original message \(but on the same level\), are'nt counted as enveloping elements. They won't be part of the resulting messages.

More information: [General and Iterating Splitter](general-and-iterating-splitter-b49d088.md)

If you use a Splitter step in a local integration process, the following limitations apply:

-   You can use Splitter and Gather steps together, but you must close each Splitter step with a Gather step.

-   You can't use a Splitter without a child element.

-   If a Splitter is used in combination with Gather, the message returned to the main process is the message at the end of the local process.

-   If a Splitter is used in the local process with a step other than Gather, the message returned to the main process is the message before the Splitter step.

-   Combinations with other steps can lead to unexpected behavior.




## Procedure

1.  In the palette, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Message Routing\), then *Splitter* \> *General Splitter*.

2.  Place the *General Splitter* element in the integration process and define the message path.

3.  On the *General* tab, you can change the name of the *General Splitter* element.

4.  On the *Processing* tab, define the attributes of the element based on the descriptions in the following table.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Field
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *XPath Expression* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    XPath to the split term

    You can specify the absolute or relative path.

    > ### Note:  
    > Note that only the following types of XPath expressions are supported:
    > 
    > -   Absolute XPath expressions, for example, `/A/B/C/D`
    > 
    > -   Relative XPath expressions, for example, `//D` 
    > 
    > 
    > The following characters are **not** supported in an XPath expression:
    > 
    > |, +, \*, \>, <, \>=, <=, \[, \], @.

    > ### Caution:  
    > You cannot split by **values** of message elements.
    > 
    > Consider the following inbound message:
    > 
    > ```
    > <customerList>
    >     <customers>
    >         <customerNumber>0001</customerNumber>
    >         <customerName>Paul Smith</customerName>
    > 	</customers>
    >     <customers>
    >         <customerNumber>0002</customerNumber>
    >         <customerName>Seena Kumar</customerName>
    >     </customers>
    > </customerList>
    > 
    > ```
    > 
    > In that case, using the following XPath expression is **not** supported to split the message at the `customerNumber` node with the value `0001`:
    > 
    > `/customerList/customers/customerNumber=0001`

    > ### Note:  
    > Note additional instructions for the usage of XPath expressions for specific cases provided under [Using XPath Expressions in the Splitter Step](using-xpath-expressions-in-the-splitter-step-c6e63f1.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > Note the following behavior if the specified XPath expression doesn't match the inbound payload: If no split point is found for the specified XPath, no outbound payload is generated from the Splitter step and the integration flow will be ended with status *Completed*.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Grouping* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The size of the groups into which the composite message is to be split.

    For example, if a message has 10 nodes and grouping is defined as 2, the message is split into 5 messages with 2 nodes each.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Streaming* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select this option if you want to stream the process of splitting a large composite message.

    If you activate streaming, the system already starts processing parts \(*chunks*\) of the composite message before the message is fully transferred to the memory \(of the runtime node\).

    If you deactivate this option, the message is transferred fully to the memory before it is split and processed further. Deactivating streaming is more memory-intensive than activating it.

    *Parallel Processing* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select this checkbox if you want to enable \(parallel\) processing of all the split messages at once.

    More information: [Cloud Integration – Using Parallel Processing in General and Iterating Splitter](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/10/17/cloud-integration-using-parallel-processing-in-general-and-iterating-splitter/) \(SAP Community blog\)
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Number of Concurrent Processes*

    \(Enabled only if *Parallel Processing* is selected\)
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    If you have selected *Parallel Processing*, the split messages are processed concurrently in threads. Define how many concurrent processes to use in the splitter. The default is 10. The maximum value allowed is 50.

    *Timeout \(in s\)*

    \(Enabled only if *Parallel Processing* is selected\)
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Maximum time in seconds that the system waits for processing all split items to complete before it is aborted. The default value is 300 seconds.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If the overall processing takes longer than the specified time, the splitter operation stops without exception, and the next elements in the integration flow sequence are processed.
    > 
    > This behavior can lead to unexpected results \(even data loss\) if not all message splits are processed within the timeout period.
    > 
    > In particular, if you are using a *Gather* step in combination with the *Splitter*, there's the risk that your output is incomplete.

    > ### Tip:  
    > **Example**
    > 
    > You've designed a *Splitter* step in combination with a closing *Gather* step.
    > 
    > The inbound payload contains 100 items to split, and you've activated *Parallel Processing* with the following settings:
    > 
    > -   *Number of Concurrent Processes*: `10`
    > 
    > -   *Timeout \(in s\)*: `60` \(1 minute\)
    > 
    > 
    > Let's assume that after 1 minute 10 of the 100 elements have been fully processed and there are further 10 elements in processing.
    > 
    > The *Parallel Processing* settings affect message processing in the following way:
    > 
    > -   The 10 fully processed messages are used in the *Gather* step to create the final, merged message.
    > 
    > -   Processing of the 10 elements that are currently in processing continues until processing is finished.
    > 
    >     However, these 10 messages are used in the *Gather* step.
    > 
    > -   The remaining 80 messages are ignored.

## Next Steps

When a message is split \(as configured in a Splitter step of an integration flow\), the Camel headers listed below are generated every time the runtime finishes splitting an Exchange. You have several options for accessing these Camel headers at runtime. For example, suppose that you are configuring an integration flow with a Splitter step before an SFTP receiver adapter. If you enter the string `split_${exchangeId}_Index${property.CamelSplitIndex}` for *File Name*, the file name of the generated file on the SFTP server contains the property `CamelSplitIndex`. This property contains the information on the number of split Exchanges induced by the Splitter step.

-   CamelSplitIndex

    Provides a counter for split items that increases for each Exchange that is split \(starts from 0\).

-   CamelSplitSize

    Provides the total number of split items \(if you are using stream-based splitting, this header is only provided for the last item, in other words, for the completed Exchange\).

-   CamelSplitComplete

    Indicates whether an Exchange is the last split.
