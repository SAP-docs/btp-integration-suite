# Manage Business Data Graphs using Graph Configuration API

As a Graph Key User, you can create a new business data graph using the Graph Configuration API.

The Graph Configuration API simplifies the process of managing your business data graphs automatically. Whether you need to create, update, or delete business data graphs, this API provides an automated option to achieve these tasks.

> ### Note:  
> The Graph Configuration API is currently limited to managing business data graphs. Managing extensions is not supported. Its primary focus is to enable a seamless integration of business data graph management with your existing CI/CD pipelines.
