# Custom Type Systems

The library of custom type systems allows you to upload custom messages, IDocs, SOA messages and custom codelists – this enables you to create MIGs and MAGs based on your own message structures. Use cases for this could be proprietary messages, standard messages extended by you and messages from B2B standards not available in the system. Within each custom type system, you can:

-   Create custom messages based on xsd and wsdl files

-   Create custom codelists
-   Create MIG and MAG
-   Customize your MIG
-   View the list of your custom messages

To upload and use custom messages/codelists, you need to have a custom type system. Follow the procedure given below to do the same.
