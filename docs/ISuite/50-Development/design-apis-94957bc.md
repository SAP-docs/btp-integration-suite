# Design APIs

An API artifact deployed on Edge Integration Cell is a managed API endpoint on SAP Integration Suite that sits in front of your backend, enforcing policies for security and traffic management.

> ### Note:  
> This feature and the information is relevant only if you have activated Edge Integration Cell in your SAP Integration Suite tenant. Availability of this feature depends upon the SAP Integration Suite service plan that you use. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Note [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776).

The Edge Integration Cell is a hybrid deployment model that enables you to deploy and run your APIs in your private landscape \(bypassing traffic through a public cloud\).

From the *Design* page, you can either select an existing content package or create a new one. SAP Integration Suite allows you to assemble integration contents into packages so that integration developers can use these packages in their integration scenarios. See, [Creating an Integration Package](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/creating-integration-package?version=CLOUD). Within the package, you can add an API artifact and define its behavior by configuring resources and applying policies.
