# Salesforce Receiver Adapter

The Salesforce receiver adapter enables an SAP Cloud Integration tenant to accelerate the implementation time and reduce the complexity of connecting to Salesforce.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

You configure the receiver channel with the Salesforce adapter to enable your tenant to send data to Salesforce customer relationship management \(CRM\) platform.

> ### Note:  
> You need to download the adapter from SAP Software Download Center. You can find more information on the download navigation path on the following web page: [Legal Disclaimer for Links](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.sap.com%2Fpackage%2FSalesforceAdapter%3Fsection%3DOverview).
> 
> After you complete the download, uncompress and extract the files to your local system. Then deploy the adapter on your tenant.
> 
> -   For more information on deploying the adapter in multicloud environment, see [Importing Custom Integration Adapter](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/482286e544014098874fde0da4bcca2c.html).

Once you’ve created a receiver channel and selected the Salesforce receiver adapter, you can configure its parameters by referring the following description:

The General tab shows general information such as the adapter type, its direction \(receiver\), the transport protocol, and the message protocol.
