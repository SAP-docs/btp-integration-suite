<a name="loiob4c9e0bec7284d9ab3a5600ba6c96553__prereq_bpd_hyr_pcc"/>

## Prerequisites

You require the role collection `DataspaceTechnicalAdmin`. See [Personas and Roles](../60-Security/identity-and-access-management-for-data-space-integration-211c66a.md#loio211c66a2f65e4bf0ad0e93e68cfff984__section_cxz_vsk_pcc).



## Context

Use company policies to define the regulations for requesting and accepting an offer. For example, you can exclude unknown or malicious individuals, or keep your users from accepting unfit offers.

Some company policies are **predelivered by SAP**, as signified in the *Created By* column. You can still assign them. Users with the role collection `DataspaceTechnicalAdmin` can also assign them.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to *Configure* \> *Data Spaces*.

2.  Choose the company policy that you want to assign, then choose *Edit*.

    Some company policies are **predelivered by SAP**, as signified in the *Created By* column. You can still assign them as they are.

3.  In the section *Assignees*, choose *Add* and enter the client ID to which you want to assign the company policy. Add as many assignees as you need. The company policy then applies to all users using this client.

4.  Save your changes.
