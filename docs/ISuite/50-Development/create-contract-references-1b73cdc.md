# Create Contract References

Maintain contract references to keep an overview of the contracts you have with other business partners in a data space.



<a name="loio1b73cdce13914d5faedf26c0c8d60c73__prereq_rjm_txh_tdc"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You require the role collection `DataspaceBusinessAdmin`. See [Personas and Roles](../60-Security/identity-and-access-management-for-data-space-integration-211c66a.md#loio211c66a2f65e4bf0ad0e93e68cfff984__section_cxz_vsk_pcc).

-   You're familiar with the contract references and business partners that you work with.



## Context

With contract references, you can keep a manual list of the contracts that exist for your company, with the respective business partners and potential use cases.

After defining contract references, you can use them to define both policies and company policies and restrict who can work with you.

> ### Note:  
> In the user interface, you're only able to see the contract references you've created yourself.



## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Suite, go to *Configure* \> *Data Spaces* \> *Contract References*.

2.  Choose *Create*.

3.  Enter the contract reference ID, a name for the contract reference, the business partner number of the contract partner, and select one or more relevant use cases.

4.  Save your changes.
