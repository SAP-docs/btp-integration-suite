# Creating an Overlay Mapping Guideline

Create an overlay mapping guideline to fulfill specific business requirements. Follow the procedure to select base MAG, source and target MIGs, and add general information, documentation, and business context details. Use it to customize standard guidelines for specific needs.



## Context

An Overlay Mapping Guideline is an extension of a standard guideline that is used to fulfill specific business requirements. Follow the procedure below to create an overlay MAG.

## Procedure

1.  Choose *MAGs* from the left pane of the application.

2.  In the *Mapping Guidelines* page, Choose .

3.  In the *Base MAG* step, select a standard MAG from the table that you want to use as the base.

4.  The *Source MIG* step displays the MIG that is used as the source in the selected base MAG. If you want to reuse the same source MIG in your overlay MAG, simply select the MIG.

    1.  To use an alternative source MIG, refer to the *Compatible MIG* tab, which lists suitable replacement MIGs. Choose one from the list to proceed.


5.  Similarly, the *Target MIG* step displays the MIG that is used as the target in the selected base MAG. If you want to reuse the same target MIG in your overlay MAG, simply select the MIG.

    1.  To use an alternative target MIG, refer to the *Use Compatible MIG* tab, which lists suitable replacement MIGs. Choose one from the list to proceed.


6.  The *MAG Creation* step displays the following information. Most of the information is automatically populated using the data from the Base MAG:

    -   *General Information*: Contains the *Name*, *Version* and *Status* of the MAG. You can edit the name of the MAG here.

    -   *Base MAG*: Displays the information about the standard MAG.
    -   *Source and Target MIGs*: Displays the details of the source and target MIGs you chose in the previous steps.
    -   *Documentation*: Contains the *Summary* for the MAG prefilled from the standard MAG. You can add the summary detail for this field.
    -   *Source Business Context*: Displays the business context details maintained in the source MIG. You can modify this information.
    -   *Target Business Context*: Displays the business context details maintained in the target MIG. You can modify this information.

7.  Choose *Create* after reviewing your choices.

8.  Once created, the newly created MAG will have the label *Overlay* below its name to distinguish it from the standard MAGs.
