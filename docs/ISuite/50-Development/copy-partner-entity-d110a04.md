# Copy Partner Entity

Copy a Partner Directory entity.



The main use case of copying a Partner Directory entity is to use it in the context of another partner \(PID\).

1.  Go to *Monitor* \> *Integrations and APIs*.

2.  Choose *Partner Directory*.
3.  In the master table, select a partner.

4.  In the detailed table at right, select first a tab for the entity type \(for example, String Parameters\) and then entry.

5.  Choose *Actions* \> *Copy*.

6.  On the *Copy <Entity Type\>* screen, edit the attributes of the entity. The editable attributes depend on the entity type, as shown in table below \(see also: [Partner Directory Entity Types](partner-directory-entity-types-950f4b2.md)\).
