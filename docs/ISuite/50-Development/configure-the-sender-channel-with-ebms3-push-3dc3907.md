# Configure the Sender Channel with ebMS3 Push

Allows you configure the sender channel with the AS4 adapter with ebMS3 Push as a receiving Message Service Handler \(MSH\).



## Context

You use AS4 message exchange protocol to securely process incoming business documents using Web services.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

*Address* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the relative endpoint of the receiving MSH. For example, `/orders`.

> ### Note:  
> When you specify the endpoint address `/path`, a sender can also call the integration flow through the endpoint address `/path/<any string>` \(for example, `/path/test/`\).
> 
> Be aware of the following related implication: When you in addition deploy an integration flow with endpoint address `/path/test/`, a sender using the `/path/test` endpoint address will now call the newly deployed integration flow with the endpoint address `/path/test/`. When you now undeploy the integration flow with endpoint address `/path/test`, the sender again calls the integration flow with endpoint address `/path` \(original behavior\). Therefore, be careful *reusing* paths of services. It is better using completely separated endpoints for services.

</th>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Quality of Service*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Defines how the message is processed by the tenant.

There are the following options:

-   *Best Effort*

    The message is sent synchronously; this means that the tenant waits for a response before it continues processing.

    No temporary storage of the message needs to be configured, as message request and response are processed immediately after another.

-   *At Least Once*

    The message is sent asynchronously. This means that the tenant does not wait for a response before continuing processing. It is expected that the receiver guarantees that the message is processed exactly once.

    This option guarantees that the message is processed at least once on the tenant. If a message with identical message ID is received multiple times from a sender, all of them will be processed.

    If you choose this option, the message needs to be temporarily stored on the tenant \(in the storage configured under *Temporary Storage*\). As soon as the message is store there, the sender receives successfully received status message. If an error occurs, the message is retried from the temporary storage.

-   *Exactly Once* \(Only possible if as *Temporary Storage* the option *Data Store* is selected\)

    The message is sent asynchronously. This means that the tenant does not wait for a response before continuing processing.

    This option guarantees that the message is processed exactly once on the tenant. If a message with identical message ID is received multiple times from a sender, only the first one will be processed. The subsequent messages can be identified as duplicates and will not be processed.

    If you choose this option, the message needs to be temporarily stored on the tenant \(in the storage configured under *Temporary Storage*\). As soon as the message is store there, the sender receives successfully received status message. If an error occurs, the message is retried from the temporary storage.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Temporary Storage*

\(only if as *Quality of Service* the option *Exactly Once* or *At Least Once* is selected\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Temporary storage location for messages that are processed asynchronously. Messages for which processing runs into an error can be retried from the temporary storage.

You can choose among the following storage types:

-   *Data Store*

    The message is temporarily stored in the database of the tenant \(in case of an error\). In case of successful message processing, the message is immediately removed from the data store.

    You can monitor the content of the data store in the *Monitor* section of the Web UI under *Manage Stores* in the *Data Stores* tile.

    > ### Note:  
    > The data store name is automatically generated and contains the following parts:
    > 
    > `<name of participant connected with AS4 adapter>_< AS4 channel name>`
    > 
    > This automatically generated name is subject to a length restriction and must be no more than 40 characters \(including the underscore\). If the data store name exceeds this limit, you must shorten the participant name or channel name accordingly.
    > 
    > Below the data store name, you find a reference to the associated integration flow in the following form: `<integration flow name>/AS4`

-   *JMS Queue*

    The message is stored temporarily in a JMS queue on the configured message broker.

    If possible, use this option as it comes with a better performance.

    You can monitor the content of the data store in the *Monitor* section of the Web UI under *Manage Stores* in the *Message Queues* tile.

    > ### Note:  
    > The name of the JMS queue is automatically generated and contains the following parts:
    > 
    > `AS4.<Integration Flow Name>.<Channel Name>.<Guide>`

Use this option to avoid out-of-memory situations \(caused in many cases by large messages\).
