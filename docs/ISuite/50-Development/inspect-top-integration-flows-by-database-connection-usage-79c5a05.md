# Inspect Top Integration Flows by Database Connection Usage

Inspect database connection usage per integration flow for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\).

Only those integration flows that are identified as top consumers of database connections are shown \(sorted top-down by average usage\).

The color shade of a cell reflects the level of database connection usage. The darkest shade reflects the highest usage observed during the selected time period.

Choose a cell to display the percent value of connection usage and to access one of the following functions for the selected integration flow \(results are filtered according to the setting of the *Time* parameter\):

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar \(see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md)\).

-   *Show Integration Content*

    Navigate to the *Manage Integration Content* screen for the related integration flow \(see [Manage Integration Content](manage-integration-content-09a7223.md)\).

-   *Inspect Integration Flow*

    Inspect the database connection usage of the selected integration flow \(see: [Inspect Resource Consumption for Individual Integration Flow](inspect-resource-consumption-for-individual-integration-flow-3380bd6.md)\).

-   *Zoom Out* and *Zoom In* to extend/reduce the selected time period.

-   *Copy Name to Clipboard*
