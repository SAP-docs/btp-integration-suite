## Procedure

2.  Choose *Add*.

3.  In the resulting dialog, select a number range from the list for the *Number Ranges* field.

    > ### Note:  
    > The field displays the number ranges that are created in the *Monitor* tab for integrations. To know more, see [Managing Number Ranges](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/managing-number-ranges).

4.  Enter an alias name for the number range in the *Name* field and choose *Save*.
