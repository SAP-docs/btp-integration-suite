# Extension Scenarios

SAP Trading Partner Management allows you to extend the capabilities of standard integration content provided by SAP. This approach allows you to implement specific integration scenarios relevant to your business use case without changing the content provided by SAP.

The generic integration flow package content comprises a set of integration flows, and other integration artifacts that cover a standard integration use case. This package can only be configured and deployed, and cannot be edited. If you want to adapt these capabilities to specific business requirements, you might consider creating one or more **custom integration flows** without the need to modify the generic integration flows. Both the standard and the custom integration flows are deployed on the same tenant and are processed in conjunction, communicating with each other using a specific adapter, the **ProcessDirect** adapter.

This section is dedicated to few of the extension scenarios where you might require creating and working with custom integration flows. We have tried to cover some of the possible scenarios you might come across that requires a detailed help. The following list provides such scenarions in individual chapters:
