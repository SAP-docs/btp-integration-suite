# Manage Product Subscriptions

Subscriptions to products created by developers can be approved and managed either automatically within the Developer Hub or through an external process.

Developers gain access to API products by creating subscriptions. Organizations can configure how these subscriptions are approved, either automatically within the Developer Hub or through an external approval process managed via API keys. This ensures proper governance, control, and secure access to APIs.

The Developer Hub administrator can modify the governance settings. See, [Configure Governance Settings](configure-governance-settings-7446560.md). The administrator can configure governance to *Auto Approval*, where subscriptions created or edited by developers are automatically approved by the system, or to *Manage Approval Outside Developer Hub*, where an external organization is responsible for managing the approval workflow.

When the *Manage Approval Outside Developer Hub* option is selected, there are two flows to govern the subscriptions. For more information, see [Setting Up External Governance](setting-up-external-governance-8b4f848.md).
