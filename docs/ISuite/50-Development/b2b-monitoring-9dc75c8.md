# B2B Monitoring

The Business to Business \(B2B\) Monitoring view provides an overview of the interchanges processed on a tenant and allows you to display the details for individual interchanges.

B2B monitoring refers to the process of tracking and overseeing the electronic exchange of business documents and data between organizations/partners. This includes monitoring the status, performance, and errors of interchanges, as well as the payloads \(data\) being exchanged.

The B2B monitoring system consists of two primary components:

-   **Monitor Interchanges**: This tile allows you to track and monitor interchanges that have been successfully assigned to a specific partner or transaction. You can view the status, performance, and errors of these interchanges, that help identify and resolve issues promptly.

-   **Monitor Unassigned Interchanges**: This tile enables you to monitor interchanges that have not been assigned to a specific partner or transaction. This includes interchanges that are pending, rejected, or require manual intervention.

Follow the procedure below to access your B2B monitoring:

1.  Log on to SAP Integration Suite .
2.  Choose *Monitor* \> *B2B Scenarios*
3.  The monitoring section opens with two tiles

    -   Interchanges

    -   Unassigned Interchanges

    Both the tiles display the interchange messages that were processed in the last 24 hours.

4.  To monitor your interchanges, see [Monitor Interchanges](monitor-interchanges-42c1199.md).
5.  To monitor your unassigned interchanges, see [Monitor Unassigned Interchanges](monitor-unassigned-interchanges-c86bd69.md).
