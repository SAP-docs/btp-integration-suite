<a name="loiocc5c942e32df494785c33ba0fc0346f4__prereq_v3f_lvp_bz"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the admin role.

-   You have created a rate plan in the SAP Integration Suite.


> ### Note:  
> A product can only be associated with one rate plan. You can also attach a rate plan to a product during the product creation.

> ### Note:  
> If you change a rate plan or add a new rate plan to a product, all the existing applications of this product will remain unaffected by the changes.
> 
> Consider the following scenario, where you have subscribed to a product P1 \(that doesn't have a rate plan attached to it\) through application A1 in the source developer portal. In this case, the API calls associated with product P1 will not get billed.
> 
> Now if you add a rate plan to product P1, this rate plan will not impact the current billing of application A1 or any other existing subscription. However, if you create a new subscription to product P1, the associated rate plan charges will be applicable.



## Context

You are attaching a rate plan to a product.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Integration Suite.

3.  On the *Configure* \> *APIs* page, choose *Products*.

4.  From the list of products available, select the product to which you want to add the rate plan.

5.  On the Product details screen, choose *RATE PLAN*.

6.  Choose *Edit â†’ Add Plan*.
