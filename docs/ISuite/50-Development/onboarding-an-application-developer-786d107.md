# Onboarding an Application Developer

As API administrators, you can onboard application developers, enabling them to access Developer Hub.

To provide application developers with access to Developer Hub, API administrators must first onboard them.

Users can be onboarded to Developer Hub in the following ways:

-   **Self-registration**: Application developers log on to Developer Hub with their IDP user credentials and register on Developer Hub. For more information, see [Registering on Developer Hub](registering-on-developer-hub-c85fafe.md).

    The API administrator receives a registration request from the user. The administrator then approves or rejects the request. For more information, see [Managing the Access Request of the Users](managing-the-access-request-of-the-users-8b79ee8.md).

-   **Add User Flow**: As an admin, you can register users by selecting *Add User* under the *Registered Users* tab on the *Manage Users* page. For more details, see step 4[Managing the Access Request of the Users](managing-the-access-request-of-the-users-8b79ee8.md) in the topic.
-   **Auto-Registration:**If the *AuthGroup.API.ApplicationDeveloper* role is already assigned to them by the SAP BTP admin or through IDP role collection mapping, users automatically register as application developers in Developer Hub upon their first login.
