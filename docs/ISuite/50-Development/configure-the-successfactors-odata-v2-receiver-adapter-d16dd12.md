# Configure the SuccessFactors OData V2 Receiver Adapter

Configure the SuccessFactors OData V2 receiver adapter by understanding the adapter parameters.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

The SuccessFactors OData V2 receiver adapter supports externalization. To externalize the parameters of this adapter, choose *Externalize* and follow the steps mentioned in [Externalize Parameters of an Integration Flow](externalize-parameters-of-an-integration-flow-45b2a07.md).

> ### Note:  
> -   The OData adapter doesn't support *$format* in query options.
> 
> -   The OData adapter supports sending error response in exception subprocess. The error response body is part of expression `${in.body}`.
> 
> -   OData services response code is captured in the `camelhttpresponsecode` header.
> 
> -   Retry for *Upsert* operation is now enabled for inner error code 412. Retry will be executed once and after 1 minute only.
> -   Learn how to construct the required payload for SuccessFactors OData V2 Upsert operation from the [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/15/payload-structure-for-successfactors-upsert-in-sap-cloud-platform-integration/).

> ### Remember:  
> You must enable *HTTP Session Reuse*, either *On Exchange* level or *On Integration Flow* level.
> 
> For more information, refer to [Specify the Runtime Configuration](specify-the-runtime-configuration-0c1c96e.md).

Additional options that you want to add to the query like `$top` or how to order the results using *orderby*. You can add this using the Model Operation Wizard.

> ### Remember:  
> While forming queries, either using the wizard or manually, you must follow the query structure recommended by SuccessFactors. For example, if you want to query records effective on a defined date, you must use the `asOfDate` parameter as recommended by SuccessFactors [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_PLATFORM/d599f15995d348a1b45ba5603e2aba9b/fce067c46f5d4d4f85a21fc9bb9b21c3.html). If a query that you form doesn't follow the recommended structure, the adapter won't be able to show errors during the design time, in turn, leading to unexpected results at runtime. This is a known limitation of the adapter.

## Modeling Operation

This adapter provides a wizard for modeling operations easily. It's recommended that you use this wizard to ensure that the operation doesn't contain any errors. The wizard can also fetch the *Externalized* parameters that are maintained under the *Connection* details of the OData V2 outbound adapter.

There are two main steps in this wizard:

1.  *Connect to System:* In this step, you provide the details required for connecting to the web service that you're accessing.
2.  *Select Entity and Define Operation:* In this step, you select the operation you want to perform and the entity on which you want to perform the operation on. After selecting the entity, you also select the fields, filtering and sorting conditions.
3.  *Configure Filter & Sorting:* This step is available only for data fetch operations, where you can define the order in which the records are fetched in the response payload and filter for the fields that you require.
