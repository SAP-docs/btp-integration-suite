# Analyze API Proxies

Use the capabilities of API Analytics to analyze API proxy usage and performance.

SAP Integration Suite provides comprehensive analytics capabilities to understand the various patterns of API consumption and performance. The API Analytics server uses the runtime data of the APIs to analyze the information. The runtime data is gathered, analyzed, and displayed as charts, headers, and key performance indicators \(KPIs\).

Use the analytics dashboard to view the aggregated results. The detailed analytics view helps to manage APIs, attract the right application developers, troubleshoot problems, and ultimately, make better business decisions.

There are two variants of analytics dashboard available for analyzing API reports:

-   **API Analytics** 

    The analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of analytical charts and KPIs relevant to the performance of the APIs. The dashboard also displays the error-related charts and KPIs such as total number of API errors, total number of system errors, and policy errors. For more information, see [API Analytics](api-analytics-6766dc3.md).

-   **Advanced API Analytics**

    Advanced API Analytics brings to you the all new analytics dashboard, providing powerful tools and in-depth reports for analyzing your API usage and performance. The reports are categorized across report pages, with each report page providing information about key API metrics, which are relevant for both business users and API developers.
