## Central Monitoring and Alerting Using SAP Cloud ALM

You can use the cloud-native solution SAP Cloud ALM to monitor business scenarios and, in particular, SAP Integration Suite tenants.

The *Monitor* application of SAP Integration Suite allows you monitor messages processed on your SAP Integration Suite tenant.

In addition to this *local* monitoring feature \(local with regard to your tenant\), you can use SAP Cloud ALM to operate your IT landscape centrally with no need to navigate to each local monitoring tool. It offers end-to-end business and IT monitoring for hybrid landscapes that brings the technical flow closer to the business context.

SAP Cloud ALM is also set as central tool for triggering alerts. Based on the raw data retrieved from the cloud applications and systems of your hybrid landscape, erroneous states can be calculated and several outbound actions triggered for proactive alerting. You can notify personas over email, chat-based applications, creating tickets to work on erroneous situations outside of SAP Cloud ALM.

> ### Note:  
> SAP Cloud ALM is SAP's cloud-based tool for application lifecycle management \(ALM\) built natively on SAP Business Technology Platform.

The following use cases of SAP Cloud ALM for Operations are relevant for the monitoring of integration scenarios end-to-end and for the alerting in case of erroneous situations:

Monitor your cloud and hybrid \(cloud and on-premise\) business scenarios end-to-end while focusing on exceptional and error situations. The system correlates single messages exchanged in a business scenario with each other and provides an end-to-end visibility across all involved components of a business scenario.

You can see the incoming and outgoing messages for each component involved in the scenario. Business users can also identify business-driven problems and search for messages based on a specific business context attributes. Integration experts can search for messages based on technical attributes. For proactive monitoring, you can oversee all open alerts in an embedded alert inbox and collaborate with others in the issue resolution process.

Additionally, you can also monitor integration-related exceptions. Examples are Cloud Integration exceptions related to artifacts that are deployed unsuccessfully on one of the monitored SAP Integration Suite tenants.

For further error analysis, you can drill down to detailed information on each single message. To tackle corrective measures, you can use a contextual link and navigate to the local monitoring application of SAP Integration Suite .
