# Workday Receiver Adapter

Workday receiver adapter enables SAP Cloud Integration and SAP Integration Suite to accelerate the implementation time and reduce the complexity of connecting to Workday.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

The Workday adapter supports the Workday SOAP API with basic authentication. Once you've created a receiver channel and selected the Workday adapter, you can configure its attributes.

The General tab shows general information such as the adapter type, its direction \(receiver\), the transport protocol, and the message protocol.
