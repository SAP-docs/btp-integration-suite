# Salesforce Sender Adapter

The Salesforce sender adapter enables Cloud Integration to accelerate the implementation time and reduce the complexity of connecting and retrieving events from Salesforce.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

> ### Note:  
> You need to download the adapter from SAP Software Download Center. You can find more information on the download navigation path on the following website: [Salesforce Adapter for SAP Integration Suite](https://api.sap.com/package/SalesforceAdapter/overview).
> 
> After you complete the download, uncompress and extract the files to your local system. Then deploy the adapter on your tenant.
> 
> -   For more information on deploying the adapter in multicloud environment, see [Importing Custom Integration Adapter](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/482286e544014098874fde0da4bcca2c.html).

Once you have created a sender channel and selected the *Salesforce* adapter, you can configure its attributes.

The *General* tab shows general information such as the adapter type, its direction \(sender\), the transport protocol, and the message protocol.

Select the *Connection* tab and provide the sender information.

*Event Type*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Specifies the event type to be retrieved from Salesforce.

Select one of the following types:

-   *PushTopic Events*

-   *Generic Events*

-   *Platform Events*

</td>

<tr>

*Replay Id Approach*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Every event or message retrieved from Salesforce Stream is assigned a `Replay ID` value. This field refers to the position of the event in the event stream.

There are 3 possible settings:

-   *Events from latest position \(-1\)* 

    Enables Cloud Integration to receive any new events. It represents `Replay ID` value `-1`. Note that the integration flow needs to be deployed and running for any new event to be received. Any event generated while the integration flow is not available will be missed.

-   *Events from earliest position \(-2\)*

    Enables Cloud Integration to receive all events that have not yet expired. It represents `Replay ID` value `-2`.

-   *Events from a specific position*

    This option gives the possibility to specify any `Replay ID`. If chosen, Cloud Integration receives all events that were created after the specified Replay ID. If the `Replay ID` is `5`, a message containing Replay Id 6, 7, 8, and so forth, is retrieved.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Replay Id*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Refers to the position of the event in the event stream. The *Replay Id* is populated by Salesforce and refers to the position of the event in the event stream. Note that the *Replay Id* values are not guaranteed to be continuous for consecutive events. By specifying the value of the *Replay Id*, the integration flow retrieves events that are within the retention window and that have followed the specified *Replay Id*. Example: If *Replay Id* 6 is specified, the integration flow receives all messages with a *Replay Id* greater than 6.
