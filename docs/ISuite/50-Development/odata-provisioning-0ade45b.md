# OData Provisioning

OData Provisioning, a capability of SAP Integration Suite exposes business data and business logic as OData services on SAP Business Technology Platform, enabling you to run user-centric applications.

The OData Provisioning capability supports OData service registration for SAP Business Suite.

OData Provisioning provides access to back-end services that are built based on the concepts of SAP Gateway and enables publishing through the cloud. With this service, you can gain access to back-end services without having to install an on-premise SAP Gateway hub system. It's enough to install non-modifying back-end enablement components of SAP Gateway. The services residing on the back end are enabled and published on the cloud.

To register OData services, see [Register OData Services](register-odata-services-9dfa56a.md).
