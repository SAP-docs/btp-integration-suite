## Prerequisites

You have created a value mapping artifact. For more information, see [Creating Value Mapping](creating-value-mapping-25eff9b.md) and [Editing Value Mapping](editing-value-mapping-6c8847f.md).



## Context

## Procedure

1.  In the integration package, navigate to *Artifacts* tab.

2.  For the artifact you want to work with, choose *Actions* <span class="SAP-icons-V5">ÓÅö</span> \> *Configure*.

3.  Choose the *Bi-Directional mapping* for which you want to add the value mapping.

4.  In the *Value mappings for* section, choose *Add* to add a value mapping and provide the values.

5.  Choose *Save* to keep the state configured.

    1.  The state of the respective *Bi-Directional mapping* changes to Configured.

    2.  Choose *Save as version* to retain a copy of the current artifact.

    3.  Choose *Cancel* to revert the changes. You can choose *Configure* in this editor to start configuring again.


    > ### Note:  
    > -   While configuring, you can't delete a bi-directional mapping.
    > -   Editing of the value mapping isn't possible if it is configured and saved. However, you can re-configure the artifact.

6.  Choose *Deploy* to deploy the configured value mapping artifact.
