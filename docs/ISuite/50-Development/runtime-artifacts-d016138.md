# Runtime Artifacts

Explore the functionality of runtime artifacts.

Runtime Artifacts are reusable, configurable objects that store dynamic values, mapping rules, and configuration settings essential for the execution and management of integrations in SAP Integration Advisor. These artifacts serve as the bridge between integration design and runtime, enabling flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency in integration processes.

These artifacts encompass more than just source-to-target schema mapping. They comprise a set of automatically generated, processable schemes \(XSD\) and transformation scripts \(XSLT\) that facilitate:

-   **Syntax Conversion**: Seamless data format transformations, such as EDI to XML or vice versa.

-   **Validation**: Verification of declared nodes and supported codes within a payload.
-   **Pre-/Post-Processing**: Addition or removal of information before or after mapping.
-   **Mapping**: Value mapping from source nodes to corresponding target nodes, enabling accurate data transformation.

Once these runtime artifacts are generated, they can be leveraged within your integration solution, enabling seamless integrations with your business partners.
