# File Resource

File resources are scripts or schemas that can be attached to flows using policies.

An API proxy container supports definition of a number of Javascript, Python, XSL scripts. It also supports XSD ad WSDL schemas. These scripts can be executed in the context of either a java script, python script, or XSL transformation policy. Once a script is defined, it can be applied as a either a java script, python script, or XSL transformation policy in different flows.
