# API Validation

The API validation policy enables you to validate incoming request messages against an OpenAPI 3.0 Specification.

This policy supports validation of the request body \(limited to application/json\), headers, and query parameters for incoming request messages. The validation process is based on an OpenAPI 3.0 Specification, provided in either JSON or YAML format. This validation functionality is applicable to both OData and REST API artifacts.

In the OpenAPI Specification, you can define the expected headers and query parameters for each API endpoint. The specification allows you to mark certain headers and query parameters as required \(mandatory\) or optional.

When a request is made to an API endpoint, the server implementing the API will validate the incoming headers and query parameters against the defined specification. If a required header or query parameter is missing, or if any of the provided headers or query parameters do not match the expected format or values, the server will respond with an error indicating the validation failure.

> ### Note:  
> For the request path, there is a strict validation. This means that in the request URL, after the base path segment, the subsequent URL segments must be registered as valid paths in the Swagger definition. For example, if you have an API modeled with the base path`/test123` and you want the API validation checks to be performed on `https://<custom domain>/test123/`, the expectation is that the trailing slash`'/'` after `/test123` is explicitly defined as the valid path in the API specification. It's important to note that the base path itself \("/test123"\) will not be accessible. Only the paths that are added after the base path and explicitly defined in the API specification will be accessible.

> ### Note:  
> If you include any additional headers or query parameters in the request that are not defined in the OpenAPI Specification, these additional parameters are allowed to pass through. The server will check if the additional parameters conform to any validation rules specified in the specification, such as data type, format, or allowed values. Also, both mandatory and optional headers and query parameters are validated against the OpenAPI Specification.

> ### Note:  
> OpenAPI Specification version 2.0 is not supported by the API validation policy.
