# Monetize APIs

SAP Integration Suite provides monetization feature to all API providers to generate revenue for using the APIs.

As an API Admin, you can create a rate plan, attach it to a product in the SAP Integration Suite, and publish the product in the API business hub enterprise. You can also view bill details of each developer in the SAP Integration Suite.

As an application developer, in the API business hub enterprise you can create an application and add products to the application. Based on the product usage, you can view the corresponding bill details.

SAP Integration Suite provides this feature through the following services:

-   [Rate Plan Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/Cloud/en-US/f4537cef059e44ee8e0f8536f80f1599.html "API Management allows user to create rate plans and attach a rate plan to a product. Through a rate plan you can charge the application developers for the use of your APIs.") :arrow_upper_right:
-   [Billing Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/Cloud/en-US/1e20fb575ad644399a7af8e1c4f423d0.html "Billing service is available in both API portal and API business hub enterprise.") :arrow_upper_right:

If you were creating, updating, or reading an application using the APIs and not through the user interface, then you need to switch to Subscription entity from Application entity to use the Monetize feature.
