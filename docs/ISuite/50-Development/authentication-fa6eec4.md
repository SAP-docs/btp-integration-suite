Select the appropriate authentication mechanism for your API.

Basic - Used in situations where simple userid/password-based authentication is sufficient.

Client Certificate â€“ The user provides a digital certificate consisting of a public and private key, which the server verifies to provide access.

oAuth - Used in situations where third-party services are allowed to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

> ### Note:  
> To execute the API with Authentication policy, configure the*Process Integration Runtime* instance, and access the endpoint using the client id/ secret or certificate from that instance.

    > ### Note:

Now, if you execute the API, the Authentication policy should be able to successfully authenticate the request.
