# Salesforce Adapter

The Salesforce sender adapter enables a SAP Cloud Integration tenant to accelerate the implementation time and reduce the complexity of connecting and retrieving events from Salesforce.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

> ### Note:  
> You need to download the adapter from SAP Software Download Center. You can find more information on the download navigation path on the following website: [Salesforce Adapter for SAP Integration Suite](https://api.sap.com/package/SalesforceAdapter/overview).
