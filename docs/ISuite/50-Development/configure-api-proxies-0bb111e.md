# Configure API Proxies

Instead of directly consuming services, application developers can access APIs created using the SAP Integration Suite.

SAP Integration Suite enables consumers to access relevant data directly in a secure manner. Selective data can be exposed while reducing the risk of security breaches. SAP Integration Suite maps a publicly available HTTP endpoint to backend services and handles the security and authorizations required to protect, analyze, and monitor your services.

You can also define a key value map that lets you create and manage collections of arbitrary key value pairs and ensure that whenever a call is made to your API, thereâ€™s a certificate attached to it that confirms the identity of the caller.

The following table lists the high level tasks that an API Administrator can perform:
