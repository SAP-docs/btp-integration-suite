# Configure the Advanced Event Mesh Sender Adapter

The AdvancedEventMesh sender adapter allows SAP Integration Suite to consume messages from queues or subscriptions in SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

> ### Note:  
> -   If your current adapter version is 1.3.3 or lower, check SAP Note [3582690](https://me.sap.com/notes/3582690) before upgrading the adapter.
> -   If you run the intergration flow associated with the AEM adapter using *Run on a single worker node* configuration, any lifecycle change to the node, such as software updates, out-of-memory exceptions, etc. may cause a brief delay in message consumption due to the switchover to a new node. To ensure smooth processing check SAP Note [3603502](https://me.sap.com/notes/3603502). We recommended upgrading to v1.3.5 for the fix.

The adapter uses the Solace Message Format \(SMF\) message protocol.

The *General* tab displays general information about the adapter itself.

*Host* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

The IP address \(or host name\) to connect to. Multiple host entries separated by commas \(up to four\) are allowed for redundancy and failover. With multiple entries, each is tried in turn until one succeeds. Host contains one or more host entries \(up to four\).

A host entry has the form:

`[Protocol:]Host[:Port]`

Protocol is the protocol used for the transport channel. The valid values are:

-   `tcp` - use a TCP channel for communications between the application and its peers. If no protocol is set, tcp is used as a default.

-   `tcps` - use a SSL channel over TCP for communications between the application and its peers. The encryption with compression is not supported.


Host is the IP address \(or host name\) to connect to for a connection.

Port is the port to connect to for a connection. A value is only required when using a port other than the automatically assigned default port number. The default port for TCP is 55555 when compression is not in use, or 55003 when compression is in use. The default port for SSL is 55443.

For example, a valid entry looks like:

`tcps://192.168.1.50:55443,192.168.1.51:55443`

This specifies two hosts using SSL over TCP on port 55443.

## Message Headers

The adapter accepts headers on both sender and receiver side.

The sender adds the following SMF headers to the Exchange: ApplicationMessageId, ApplicationMessageType, CoS, CorrelationId, DeliveryCount, Destination, DestinationEndpointType, Expiration, HttpContentEncoding, HttpContentType, IsDiscardIndication, IsDMQEligible, IsElidingEligible, IsRedelivered, IsReplyMessage, Priority, ReceiveTimestamp, ReplicationGroupMessageId, ReplyToEndpointType, ReplyToDestination, SenderId, SenderTimestamp, SequenceNumber, TimeToLive, UserProperties.

In addition to the SMF headers there are some non-SMF headers as well that are added to the Exchange by the sender.

> ### Note:  
> These non-SMF headers are not automatically persisted on the message beyond the Exchange.

1.  LocalProcessingAttempt: The count of processing attempts per delivery of a message from the advanced event mesh Queue or Durable Topic Endpoint.

2.  TotalLocalProcessingAttempt: The total processing attempts for all deliveries which includes redelivery of a message from the advanced event mesh. Note: For the count to be accurate, ensure the DeliveryCount feature is enabled on the respective Queue or Durable Topic Endpoint and all the delivery attempts are made within the same integration flow.

3.  The sender supports the propagation of header `SAP_MplCorrelationId`. If the incoming message already contains a header `SAP_MplCorrelationId`, the same value is propagated into the exchange headers.


When setting up the integration flow, add them to the allowlist. To do that, click the modeling area outside any integration flow shape. Then, choose *Runtime Configuration* \> *Allowed Header\(s\)*, if required.

See [Specify the Runtime Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/specify-runtime-configuration)
