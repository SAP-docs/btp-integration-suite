# Inspect Top Data Stores by Usage

Inspect local and global data stores by database usage \(in MB\) for a selected time period.

You can choose to display information about global or local data stores by using the *Data Store Visibility*menu. Local data stores are accessible exclusively by single integration flows, while global data stores are accessible by all integration flows deployed on a tenant.

The heat map displays only the data stores identified as top database volume consumers. These are sorted from highest to lowest based on database volume usage. The color shade of each cell reflects the level of database volume usage.

Select a cell to get more context information and to get access to the following functions:

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar \(see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md)\).

-   *Show Data Stores*

    Navigate to the *Data Stores* tile, *Manage Stores* screen, to show all data stores of the tenant \(see [Managing Data Stores](managing-data-stores-ac39f1d.md)\).

-   *Inspect Data Store* 

    Inspect resource consumption for the selected data store.

-   *Zoom Out* and *Zoom In* to extend/reduce the selected time period.â€ƒ

-   *Copy Name to Clipboard* 


You can also access the functions below in the heat maps that show **local** data stores:

-   *Show Database Connections*

    Inspect database connection usage \(it can correlate with database consumption by data stores\). For more information, see [Inspect Top Integration Flows by Database Connection Usage](inspect-top-integration-flows-by-database-connection-usage-79c5a05.md).

-   *Show Integration Content*

    Inspect the selected artifact \(see [Manage Integration Content](manage-integration-content-09a7223.md)\).
