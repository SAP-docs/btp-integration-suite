# Creating a Script Collection



## Procedure

1.  Open your integration package and choose *Edit*.

2.  In the *Artifacts* tab, choose *Add* \> *Script Collection*.

3.  In the *Add Script Collection* dialog box, choose one of the following options:

    -   *Create* – to create a script collection.

    -   *Upload* – to upload a .zip file that contains the resources for a script collection. You can download such a file from other integration packages.

        > ### Note:  
        > Download the script collection from an integration package in *Design* workspace. Don't download the script collection from the runtime or deployment views. Currently, Cloud Integration supports only the upload of .zip files.


4.  Enter the script collection details as listed in the following table:
