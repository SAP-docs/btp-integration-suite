# Keep Readability in Mind

Readability of the integration flow is crucial for its maintainability.

> ### Note:  
> You can find the example integration flows that illustrate the guidelines explained in this section in the following integration package published on SAP Business Accelerator Hub:
> 
> [Integration Flow Design Guidelines - Keep Readability in Mind](https://api.sap.com/package/DesignGuidelinesKeepReadabilityinMind?section=Overview)
> 
> For more information, see [Copying the Integration Package and Deploying the Integration Flows](copying-the-integration-package-and-deploying-the-integration-flows-2cb1d31.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you don't consider the proposed guidelines during integration design, there's the risk that your scenario is affected in the following way:
> 
> -   It is difficult to understand the business logic of a scenario \(for topic newbies\).
> 
> -   It is difficult for the integration expert to maintain the scenario.

> ### Note:  
> It can be the case that you've applied the integration flow design guidelines described in this section to your best knowledge, but you still face issues during the operation of the scenario. For example, you have applied all design rules with regard to performance but still the performance isn't good enough at runtime. In such cases, you can check out the following page to search for a service that helps you to optimize the implementation of your scenario: [SAP Services and Support](https://www.sap.com/services-support.html).
