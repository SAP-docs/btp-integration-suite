# Configure the SuccessFactors SOAP Receiver Adapter

The SuccessFactors SOAP receiver adapter connects a tenantSAP Cloud Integration to SOAP-based Web services of a SuccessFactors receiver system \(synchronous or asynchronous communication\).

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

> ### Remember:  
> You must enable *HTTP Session Reuse* with either the *On Exchange* or *On Integration Flow* level.
> 
> For more information, see [Specify the Runtime Configuration](specify-the-runtime-configuration-0c1c96e.md).

Once you've created a receiver channel and selected the SuccessFactors \(SOAP\) receiver adapter, you can configure the following attributes. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > Support for *OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion* was released in June 2021. If you're using an older version of the adapter \(where you don't see the dropdown *Authentication*\) and yet want to use this authentication type without editing the adapter, do the following:

*Process in Pages* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

By selecting *Process in Pages*, you enable the adapter to process messages in batches. The size of a message is defined by the value that you specify for the *Page Size*.

> ### Note:  
> After fetching the first page in the local integration process, if the processing of this page by subsequent flow steps results in SuccessFactors idle session timeout, then the SuccessFactors connector internally uses the `startRow` API to fetch the next page.

You can't use the *Process in Pages* option with the *Query* operation if the *Process Call* step is used in a *Multicast* branch.

To use *Process in Pages*, you must use the adapter in a *Local Integration Process* that is invoked by a *Looping Process Call* step. In the *Looping Process Call*, provide the loop condition details that follow:

-   Select *Expression Type* as *Non-XML*.

-   For *Condition Expression*, provide `${property.SAP_SuccessFactorsHasMoreRecords.<receiver.name>} contains 'true'`.

    In case you've also set a channel name, set the *Condition Expression* as `${property.SAP_SuccessFactorsHasMoreRecords.<receiver.name>.<channel.name>} contains 'true'`.

-   For *Maximum Number of Iterations*, provide `999`.
