# Build and Deploy Status

Indicates the status of an artifact that is triggered for deployment.

You can access integration flow configurations through the `BuildAndDeployStatus` resource.

For integration artifacts that have reached the worker node, another status becomes relevant, the runtime status. The runtime status indicates if a deployed artifact is ready to operate \(see [Runtime Status](runtime-status-c14a7b1.md)\).

There are the following status values for the build and deploy status.
