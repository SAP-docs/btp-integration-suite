# Exporting Integration Packages

Download your integration packages to your local system, so that you can provide it to your content management team to upload and publish them. Publishing integration packages makes them available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.



## Procedure

1.  Choose *Design* \> *Integrations and APIs* \> *s* to view the list of integration packages.

2.  Select the required integration package.

3.  Choose *Export*.

    By default, the current active version of the artifact gets downloaded. The downloaded file takes the name of the integration package. In case the name contains special characters, the browser changes the file name by appending them. The destination of export depends on the default browser setting.

    > ### Note:  
    > Configure-only content can't be downloaded.
