    A list of all business systems is displayed.

    -   **Create a product from a single consumption bundle**

        1.  Select the consumption bundle and choose *Create Product*.

        2.  The name, ID, short text, and description from the consumption bundle are pre-populated. However, you're free to make any changes. After you've checked the product details, select *Next*.
        3.  You can choose the Events you'd like to add or remove from the product. Once you've made your selections, choose *Next*.
        4.  Review the product details and choose one of the following options:
            -   *Save as Draft*: If you pick this option, the product stays in a *Draft* state and you can publish it whenever you want. It's not available in the catalog until you publish it.

            -   *Publish*: If you choose this option, the product publishes and becomes available in the catalog. You can discover it, but you can't subscribe to the product.


    -   **Create products from multiple consumption bundles**

        1.  Select the consumption bundles and choose *Create Product*.

        2.  You can view the consumption bundles you've selected in the *Selected Consumption Bundles* section. At this point you can either publish the product or save the product as a draft.

            > ### Note:  
            > When you select multiple consumption bundles, the system creates a product for each one. It uses the names and descriptions of the selected bundles for these products.

            -   *Save as Draft*: When you select this option, it keeps the products in a draft state. You're free to publish them at any time. However, they're not available in the catalog until you do so..

            -   *Publish*: If you choose this option, the products are published. They become available in the catalog for discovery. However, the products are not available for subscription.
