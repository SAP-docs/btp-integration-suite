# Naming Conventions

The naming conventions defined in the following chapter are meant as a recommendation. Naming conventions are subjective and can be applied in multiple ways. However, the guidelines defined here are a good starting point and, if necessary, can be extended or modified.



It's important to have a logical system behind the naming patterns applied. This system helps you to quickly organize and identify all the numerous objects related in an integration environment. In the following guidelines, the case for an organization with multiple subsidiaries is considered. In case some objects depend on a specific subcompany, the placeholder `<Business Unit>` is used. However, when the objects don't specify a business unit but a whole group, then use the constant `<Global>` instead. The multicompany use case can be extrapolated to other distributions, like divisions, countries/regions, areas, and so forth. If this classification isn't needed, it can be omitted. Also, a good practice is to use CamelNotation in any of the placeholders used. The square brackets indicate an optional part of the naming convention, which may not be required in all use cases.



### Integration Packages

The Integration Package is the folder containing or organizing your integration content \(integration flows, value mappings, APIs, and so forth\). Right now, an integration package is the minimum unit that can be transported. See [Creating an Integration Package](creating-an-integration-package-9126d79.md).

The naming convention for custom integration packages is as follows:

`[<CompanyPrefix>]_<BusinessUnit|Global> _<IntegrationScenario>_[<InvolvedSystems>]_[<AdditionalInformation>]` 

Packages that contain reusable objects across different integration packages should be named by a standardized identifier, for example, COMMON, REUSE.

Example:

`[<CompanyPrefix>]_<BusinessUnit|Global>_<IntegrationScenario>_COMMON`

**Naming Guidelines for Custom Integration Package**


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Scope*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Tenant

The Integration Package is the uppermost unit in Cloud Integration. The name must be unique for the tenant.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Definition*

</td>
<td valign="top">

-   *Company Prefix \(Optional\)*: 3 or 4 letter prefix for your company. Ease distinction between own custom-built content and pre-packaged content from SAP and partners.

-   *Business Unit*: Business Unit to which the package belongs to \(example: SubsidiaryA\)

-   *Global*: Constant used if the package isn't bound to a specific business unit, but to the entire group.

-   *Integration Scenario*: The integration scenario groups the objects of the package by end-to-end scenarios or business processes \(example: OrderIntegration, E-Invoicing, HR\).

-   *Involved Systems \(Optional\)*: In some cases, it's helpful to have information about the systems involved. However, never use technical nor environment-dependent names, but generic names \(example: Ariba, SuccessFactors\).

-   *Additional Information \(Optional\)*: Country key \(2-digit\), Object \(in CamelCase notation\), or any other description not included in the integration scenario, which is needed to specify the package \(example: DE/GB/CH, Payroll, and so forth\)

-   *Integrated Products*: Two or more products between which the integration takes place.


In case, an integration package is to be copied, then follow the next rules: Use the tag `<AdditionalInformation>` at the end to differentiate the new package from the copied one. For example, use the country key.

</table>

> ### Note:  
> For standard packages, you can't define names as they are already predefined. If you need more than 1 version of the same standard package, differentiate between your standard packages with the help of suffixes when copying them. In this case, the same naming conventions apply as for custom packages. Use abbreviations to shorten package names to keep them readable.

### Integration Flow

An integration flow allows you to specify how a message is processed on a tenant.

The naming convention is as follows:

`BusinessUnit|Global>_<BusinessObject>_[<Sender>_to_<Receiver>]_[<AdditionalInformation>]`

**Naming Guidelines for Integration Flow**


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Scope*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Integration Package/Tenant

Integration flows are organized in integration packages. However, the ID must be unique for the tenant.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Definition*

</td>
<td valign="top">

-   *Business Unit*: Business Unit to which the package belongs to \(Example: SubsidiaryA\)

-   *Global*: Constant used if the package isn't bound to a specific business unit, but to the entire group

-   *Sender\_to\_Receiver \(Optional\)*: In some cases, it's helpful to have information of the sender and receiver of an integration flow. However, never use technical nor environment-dependent names, but generic names \(example: S4\_to\_SuccessFactors\).

-   *Sender/Receiver*: In some cases, it's helpful to have information of the sender or receiver of an integration flow. However, never use technical nor environment-dependent names, but generic names \(example: SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, BW\).

-   *Additional Information \(Optional\)*: Country key \(2-digit\), Identifier or any other additional information relevant for the integration flow




</td>

</table>



### Script Collection

A Script Collection contains a bundle of scripts. Create a script collection within an integration package so that you create scripts in it and then reuse the bundle of scripts across any number of integration artifacts in your tenant. See [Creating a Script Collection](creating-a-script-collection-824bff0.md)

The naming convention is as follows:

`SC_<BusinessUnit|Global>_<Description>`

**Naming Guidelines for Script Collection**


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Scope*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Integration Package

The script collections are organized in integration packages. The id must be unique for the entire tenant.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Definition*

</td>
<td valign="top">

<td valign="top">

The maximum character length for this parameter is 120.

</td>
</tr>
</table>



### OData, SOAP, and Rest APIs

Cloud Integration supports API-based integration development exposing integration flows as either OData, SOAP, or RESTful services. For example, OData APIs can be consumed by SAP Fiori apps, SAP Mobile Services, or any other custom app, to implement user-centric scenarios. See [Develop API-Based Integration Artifacts](develop-api-based-integration-artifacts-997501d.md).

The naming convention is as follows:

`<BusinessUnit|Global>_<Resource>_<SourceSystem>_[<AdditionalDescription>]` 

**Naming Guidelines for API-Based Integration Development**


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Scope*

</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
<td valign="top">

-   *Business Unit*: Business Unit to which the package belongs to \(example: SubsidiaryA\)

-   *BusinessProcess*: Business process where all the objects of the package can be classified \(example: Purchasing, HumanResources, MM, OrderToCash or any other possible area\)

-   *Sender/Receiver*: In some cases, it's helpful to have information of the sender or receiver of an integration flow. However, never use technical nor environment-dependent names, but generic names \(example: SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, BW\).

-   *InterfaceDescription*: Use a meaningful name in camel notation, including object/business case. As OData usually include several operations, it is not needed to include the operation \(example: PurchaseOrder, PlanningData, EmployeeAbsence, Payroll\). In case additional information is still needed to identify the Integration Flow, add it here \(for example, Country, Interface Id, â€¦\).




</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">

### Participants in Integration Flows

You define a participant of an integration flow as a sender or receiver. The senders and receivers typically represent the customer systems that are connected to the tenant and exchange messages with each other. See [Elements of an Integration Flow](elements-of-an-integration-flow-e49dbee.md).

The naming convention is as follows:

-   `<IntegrationType>_<Application>`

**Naming Guidelines for Sender/Receiver**


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Scope*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Integration Flow

Participants of different integration flows can have the same name. This naming convention for participants is just for documentation and readability purposes. It has no technical impact during deployment and doesn't collide with participants of other already deployed integration flows.

### Mappings

Mappings are programs that enable you to define an association between fields of messages with different structuring. See [Working with Mapping](working-with-mapping-68d816a.md).

The naming convention is as follows:
