You can create integration artifacts of types REST, SOAP, andOData APIs. The API-based artifacts generate a default integration design that you can further extend to meet your requirements. After you complete your integration design, you can save and deploy the artifacts. Finally, you can create your own tiles in the monitoring section to view your API-based artifacts that are deployed.
