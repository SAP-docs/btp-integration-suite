# Deploying an OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion

Many web servers use OAuth 2.0 for authorization purposes. If you want to connect to a system that uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, you need to deploy an OAuth2 Credentials artifact using the following procedure.



<a name="loio3ee658286bac40829fcfa4e0c9044f75__prereq_f5s_4px_1pb"/>

## Prerequisites

For technical user propagation workflow, you've created a key pair. See [Creating a Key Pair/SSH Key Pair](creating-a-key-pair-ssh-key-pair-b8a8601.md).

## Context

You can design your OAuth2 credential either via principal propagation or technical user propagation.

-   Using principal propagation, you forward the identity of the logged-in user to the target OAuth2-supported system. This method works well during the runtime \(execution\) of integration artifacts.

-   Using technical user propagation, you propagate a dedicated technical user profile mentioned in the key-pair common name as the principal to your target system. Currently, this method works with SuccesFactors OData V2 Receiver, SuccesFactors SOAP Sender, and SuccesFactors SOAP Receiver Adapters. Especially, in the query modeler, use technical user propagation. To know more about how to implement technical user propagation, read the [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/03/26/sap-cloud-integration-oauth2-saml-bearer-x.509-certificate-authentication-support-in-successfactors-connector/).


> ### Note:  
> Read [SAP Cloud Integration â€“ Principal Propagation with SuccessFactors OData V2](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/07/30/sap-cloud-platform-integration-principal-propagation-with-successfactors-odata-v2/), to understand how to design, and deploy an integration flow that communicates to SuccessFactors OData V2 endpoint with OAuth2 authentication.
