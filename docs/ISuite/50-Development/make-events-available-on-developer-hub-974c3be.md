# Make Events Available on Developer Hub 

Developer Hub acts as a centralized repository where content administrators can showcase their events, and provide corresponding documentation.

To effectively publish an event, it is crucial to understand how to bundle them together and present them as a cohesive product. Once the required events are included in a product, it can be published to the catalog, allowing application developers to browse through and access it.
