# ODC Receiver Adapter

The ODC adapter enables you to communicate with systems that expose data through the OData Channel for SAP Gateway.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

Once you have created a receiver channel and selected the ODC Receiver Adapter, you can configure the following attributes. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).
