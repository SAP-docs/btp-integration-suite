# Deploying an OAuth2 Client Authorization Code with Generic Provider

Create an OAuth2 Client Authorization Code with the Generic Provider.

## Context

Cloud Integration supports OAuth Clients with various update processes for their refresh tokens:

-   *Refresh Tokens that expire and are invalidated*: There are some OAuth clients that create a new refresh token that automatically and immediately invalidates the old refresh token. This means, the old refresh token can no longer be used as soon the new refresh token is available.

    Example: OAuth Client of GoToWebinar;

-   *Refresh Tokens that expire but aren't invalidated*: There are some OAuth Clients that create a new refresh token, however, the old refresh token is still valid until its expiry date. In this case, a refresh token is valid during the whole expiry period, that is from creation time to creation time + expiry period.

-   *Refresh Tokens that don't expire*: There are OAuth clients whose refresh token don't expire. In this case the refresh token doesnâ€™t need to be updated at all.


> ### Note:  
> The following update processes aren't supported:
> 
> -   OAuth Clients with refresh tokens that do expire but that can't be updated \(rotated\) aren't supported, since the connection doesn't work anymore after the refresh token has expired. This applies, for instance, to the SAP XSUAA OAuth client.
> 
> -   OAuth Clients which require proprietary parameters for updating the refresh token in the token request, for instance Microsoft 365, which will only return the refresh token in the token request, if you specify the scope "offline\_access". See: [Deploying an OAuth2 Client Authorization Code with Microsoft 365 as Provider](deploying-an-oauth2-client-authorization-code-with-microsoft-365-as-provider-04a94b1.md).

There are OAuth clients which require additional query parameters in the token or authorization URL.

SAP Integration Suite supports these kinds of OAuth clients. You can just specify these parameters in the URL, for example:

-   the *Google OAuth client* requires the additional query parameters "prompt=consent" and "access\_type=offline" in the authorization URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?prompt=consent&access\_type=offline;

-   the *Dropbox client* requires the additional query parameter "token\_access\_type=offline" in the authorization URL: https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=<app\_id\>&token\_access\_type=offline&response\_type=code&redirect\_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fcode&state=123;


> ### Caution:  
> -   The Refresh Token expiry period must be at least 3 days.
> 
> -   The update of the Refresh Token must occur at least 2 days before the Refresh Token expires.
> 
> -   Refresh Tokens that are invalidated after their first usage are not supported.
> 
> -   A refresh token must not be invalidated by a succeeding refresh token before 20 per cent of the expiry period is reached.
> 
> -   The Access Token expiry period must be at least 30 min. We recommend an expiry period of 1 hour.
> 
> -   The maximum number of OAuth2 Authorization Code credentials is 500 \(including the Microsoft 365 credentials\).
> 
> -   You can't use the same OAuth Client that supports only one valid Refresh Token in one point in time in more than one OAuth2 Authorization Code credential with the same user.

## Procedure

1.  Choose *Monitor* \> *Integrations and APIs*.

2.  Select the target runtime \(*Runtime* parameter\).

    This information is only relevant for Edge Integration Cell runtime.

    For more information on how to manage security artifacts for Edge Integration Cell, see [Manage Security for Edge Integration Cell](../manage-security-for-edge-integration-cell-1783cf8.md).

3.  Click the *Security Material* tile in the *Manage Security* section.

4.  Choose *Add*.

5.  As *Type*, select *OAuth2 Authorization Code*.

6.  Specify the following attributes:

    ****


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Authorization URL
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Provide the Authorization URL for authorizing the OAuth client to access resources of a user.

    You can add also additional query parameters, as described at the beginning of this chapter. Be aware that the following query parameters are added automatically: `client_id=<client_id>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=<url encoded redirect uri>&state=<state guid>&scope=<scope>`. The scope query part is only added if the scope attribute is not empty, see below.

    Token Service URL

    <td valign="top">
    
    Provide the URL that generates the OAuth2 access and refresh token for the registered OAuth2 client and the provided user.

    You can add also additional query parameters, as described at the beginning of this chapter. The scope attribute \(see below\) is added as query parameter automatically in case of the "authorization\_code" grant type request; the scope attribute is not added in case of the "refresh\_token" grant type request.

    <td valign="top">
    
    Provide an amount of time \(in days\) after which the refresh token expires. The minimum value is 3 days.

    You can also leave this attribute blank \(don't type in anything\), in case your refresh token doesn't expire \(see: Supported OAuth Client Types in this chapter\). The default value is blank.

    <td valign="top">
    
    OAuth2 scopes protecting the access to the resources.

    The scope value is added to the Authorization URL \(see above\) as query parameter and is also added to the Token Service URL, in case of the "authorization\_code" grant type request; but is not added to the Token Service URL in case of the "refresh\_token" grant type request \(see above\).

    > ### Note:

    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    > ### Note:  
    > Test your new setup regularly in the beginning, to waterproof the functionality of your setup. Especially test the replacement of refresh tokens, whether they expire or the new refresh token invalidates the old refresh token.

7.  Choose *Deploy*.
