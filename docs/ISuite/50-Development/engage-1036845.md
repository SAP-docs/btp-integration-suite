# Engage

Create products and view application details in SAP Integration Suite.

The *Engage* section allows you create products, which represent a logical grouping of APIs. It allows you to bundle related APIs together, making it easier to manage and govern them as a unit. Products can be used to define usage quotas for the APIs they contain.

You can also view the subscribed applications developer details, and products associated with this application from this section. Applications represent a client application endpoint that can be consumed by application developers. It could be a mobile app, a web application, or any other type of software that interacts with your APIs. Applications are used to control access to APIs by defining authentication and authorization mechanisms.

The following table lists the tasks that an Application Developer, Application Consumer, and an API Administrator can perform:
