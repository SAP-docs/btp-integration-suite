# Configure the SuccessFactors \(SOAP\) Sender Adapter

The SuccessFactors \(SOAP\) sender adapter connects an SAP Cloud Integration tenant to SOAP-based Web Services of a SuccessFactors sender system \(synchronous or asynchronous communication\).

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

> ### Remember:  
> You must enable *HTTP Session Reuse* with either the *On Exchange* or *On Integration Flow* level.
> 
> For more information, see [Specify the Runtime Configuration](specify-the-runtime-configuration-0c1c96e.md).
