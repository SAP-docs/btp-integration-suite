It includes the business context, contact, systems involved, communication parameters, certificates, active B2B scenarios, message implementation guidelines, functional or application acknowledgements, as well as the identifications and further parameters necessary to uniquely identify the specific trading partner in an receiving interchange as well as setting the appropriate information in the envelopes of a sending interchange.
