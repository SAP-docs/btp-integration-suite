# Configure the RabbitMQ Receiver Adapter

You use the RabbitMQ receiver adapter to send messages from SAP Integration Suite to exchanges or queues on the RabbitMQ server.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a third-party web service that is outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

Once you have created a receiver channel and selected the RabbitMQ receiver adapter, you can configure the following attributes.

    Connect to the RabbitMQ server using client certificate authentication.

    To use this option, you need to upload a certificate has to the keystore in the *Monitor* \> *Integrations* section under *Manage Security* \(*Keystore* tile\). Using the deployed private key, the adapter connects to the RabbitMQ server.

-   *SASL*

    Connect to the RabbitMQ server using Simple Authentication and Security Layer \(SASL\).

    To use this option, you need to deploy a *User Credentials* artifact in the *Monitor* \> *Integrations*section under *Manage Security* \(*Security Material* tile\). Using the alias name for the Credential, adapter will get username and password to connect to the RabbitMQ server.
