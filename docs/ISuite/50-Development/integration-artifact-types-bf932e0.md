# Integration Artifact Types

You can design the following integration artifact types with the Cloud Integration capability activated.

-   Integration flow

    Specifies how messages are exchanged within an integration scenario \(see [Creating an Integration Flow](creating-an-integration-flow-da53d93.md)\).

-   Value mapping

    Maps two ways of representing the same object with each other. You use value mappings when you need to exchange messages between two systems that represent the same object in different ways \(see [Configuring Value Mappings](configuring-value-mappings-6c8847f.md)\).

-   SOAP API

    A SOAP API-based integration flow with a SOAP 1.x sender adapter \(see [Create and Deploy a SOAP API Artifact](create-and-deploy-a-soap-api-artifact-1a439af.md) \).

-   OData API

    An OData API-based integration scenario with OData V2 sender adapter \(see [Create and Deploy an OData API Artifact](create-and-deploy-an-odata-api-artifact-8bc912d.md)\).

-   REST API

    A REST API-based integration scenario with HTTPS sender adapter \(see [Create and Deploy a REST API Artifact](create-and-deploy-a-rest-api-artifact-fec774c.md)\).

-   Message mapping

    Transforms a source into a target message \(see [Creating Message Mapping as an Artifact](creating-message-mapping-as-an-artifact-1d52a7b.md)\).

-   Script collection

    A set of scripts that can be used in a Script integration flow step \(see [Creating a Script Collection](creating-a-script-collection-824bff0.md)\).

-   Function Libraries

    Contains functions from ESR that can be used in a mapping \(see [Working with Function Libraries](working-with-function-libraries-dd8c30d.md)\).

-   Imported Archives

    Contains imported archives from ESR that can be used in a mapping \(see [Working with Imported Archives](working-with-imported-archives-e00e81d.md)\).

-   Integration adapter

    Allows you to import a custom adapter into your integration package \(see [Importing Custom Integration Adapter](importing-custom-integration-adapter-482286e.md)\).

-   Data type

    Contains the structure of data that defines the message \(see[Working with Data Types & Message Types](working-with-data-types-message-types-cf1d397.md) \).

-   Message type

    Describes the structure of a message \(see [Working with Data Types & Message Types](working-with-data-types-message-types-cf1d397.md)\).
