## Inspect Top Integration Flows by Storage Usage

Inspect the volume of temporary storage used by different integration flows during a specific time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\). Only those integration flows that are identified as top consumers are shown, sorted top-down by average storage usage.

The color shade of the cells reflects the level of storage usage. The darkest shade reflects the highest usage observed during the selected time period.

## Inspect Top Integration Flows by Maximum File Size

Inspect the maximum file size per integration flow for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\). Only those integration flows that are identified as having the maximum file size are shown, sorted top-down by average usage.

The darkest shade of the cells reflects the highest usage observed during the selected time period.
