# Monetize APIs

SAP Integration Suite provides monetization feature to all API providers to generate revenue for using the APIs.

As an API Admin, you can create a rate plan, attach it to a product in the SAP Integration Suite, and publish the product in the Developer Hub. You can also view bill details of each developer in the SAP Integration Suite.

As an application developer, in the Developer Hub you can create an application and add products to the application. Based on the product usage, you can view the corresponding bill details.

SAP Integration Suite provides this feature through the following services:

-   [Rate Plan Service](rate-plan-service-f4537ce.md)
-   [Billing Service](billing-service-1e20fb5.md)

If you were creating, updating, or reading an application using the APIs and not through the user interface, then you need to switch to Subscription entity from Application entity to use the Monetize feature. For more information, see [Create or Update or Read an Application using Subscription key](create-or-update-or-read-an-application-using-subscription-key-e2645b5.md)
