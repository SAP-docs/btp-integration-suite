## Context

Once you enable the API Management capability, you’ll need to configure the service. For a first-time user, only the *Configure* tab is visible on the *Settings* \> *Runtimes* page.

> ### Note:  
> To activate your trial account, you must have the APIManagement.Selfservice.Administrator role collection assigned. Once assigned, you can activate the runtime environment by navigating to *Settings* \> *Runtimes* \> *Activate*.



## Procedure

1.  After enabling the API Management capability in SAP Integration Suite, go to *Settings* \> *Runtimes* from the left navigation pane.

2.  Select the *Configure* tab under *API Management*.

3.  Under *Account*, select the *Account Type*.

    -   Select *Non-Production* account type for, nonbusiness critical activities, integrating test systems, testing new scenarios, performance testing, and sandbox activities.
    -   Select *Production* account type for business critical usage, integrating production systems, and productive APIs.

4.  In the *Virtual Host* section, enter the *Host Alias*.

    > ### Note:  
    > The Virtual Host alias allows a maximum of 63 characters.

    Virtual hosts are the base URLs of an API Proxy that identifies your organization. Once you enter the host alias, your API Proxy would appear in the default API Management domain as shown here:

    Example: https://<virtualHost\>.apimanagement.hana.ondemand.com.

5.  Provide an e-mail ID in the *Notification Contact* field to receive updates. You can also add multiple e-mail IDs. To add more than one e-mail ID, use the `Tab` key on your keyboard.

6.  Select the *Make <User ID\> API Portal administrator* checkbox to assign the `APIPortal.Administrator` role to the mentioned user. Assigning administrator role helps the user to access API portal user interface and services.

7.  Choose *Activate*.

8.  In the *Set-up Confirmation*window, review the provided details and choose*Confirm* to start the onboarding process.

    You're now navigated to a progress window, which states *API Management Service Setup In Progress*.

    The *Configuration* process is triggered, where the necessary resources are provisioned for you, followed by *Testing the Setup* process, where a simple API Proxy is deployed and invoked to check that everything is set up properly.

    As and when the processes complete the indicators turn green to indicate that the processes are successful. Then, a *Release Notification* mail is sent out to the e-mail IDs provided in the *Configure the API Management Service* screen. This e-mail contains details of the newly set up API Management service on your account.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the API Management Service Setup encounters an error or fails, the onboarding process will automatically retry the setup up to three times. If the same error or failure continues to occur, please report the issue by creating an incident in the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html). Please use the component OPU-API-OD-DT for reporting.

## Next Steps

After completing the setup, logout of the Integration Suite application and login again. The *Connections* tab appears on the *Settings* page.

To publish the Integration Suite API portal content on the **Developer Hub**, Integration Suite should be connected to Developer Hub. Choose *Test Connection* and see the *Connection Status* change to *Success*.

> ### Note:  
> If you've activated Developer Hub while enabling API Management capability, the connection to Developer Hub is established automatically. You can test the connection using *Test Connection*.
> 
> If you want to connect Integration Suite to a centralized Developer Hub, you must create a connection request. For more information, see [Create a Connection Request for the Centralized Developer Hub](../create-a-connection-request-for-the-centralized-developer-hub-c7bda8c.md).
