# Bind to Data Source

You have created an OData model in the Cloud Integration Web application. As a result, you can see OData objects associated with the model listed in a table on the Service Designer page.

Next, you need to bind or connect function imports and operations of entity sets to a data source. When you bind an OData object to a data source, a predefined integration flow is autogenerated and set up for you. You can modify this integration flow to suit your scenario.

> ### Note:  
> The externalise option is not visible for these autogenerated integration flows.

You can bind one or all five CRUDQ operations of an entity set to a data source. This means that each entity set can have multiple integration flows connecting to the same data source. You can also bind entity sets and function imports in an OData API artifact to different data sources.

The following data sources are currently supported:

-   SOAP

-   OData

-   REST

-   ODC




## Binding Status

To identify the graphical representations of the OData objects and their binding status on the Service Designer page, refer to the following table:

## Unused Bindings

After binding an entity set or function import to a data source, if you rename or delete it in the OData Model Editor, the binding is no longer associated with it and becomes unused. You cannot deploy theOData API unless you update the binding. For more information, see [Managing Unused Bindings](managing-unused-bindings-585639c.md).
