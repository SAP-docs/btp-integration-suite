> ### Note:  
> It can be the case that you've applied the integration flow design guidelines described in this section to your best knowledge, but you still face issues during the operation of the scenario. For example, you have applied all design rules with regard to performance but still the performance isn't good enough at runtime. In such cases, you can check out the following page to search for a service that helps you to optimize the implementation of your scenario: [SAP Services and Support](https://www.sap.com/services-support.html).

For each design guideline, one or more reference integration flows are documented. You can also access the integration flows from SAP Business Accelerator Hub as described in [How to Work with the Example Integration Flows](how-to-work-with-the-example-integration-flows-03e6959.md).

The integration flows are designed to meet the following requirements:

-   Each integration flow focuses on one dedicated guideline or pattern to make it easy for you to understand the topic.

-   Each integration flow can be deployed and executed with minimum effort. That way, you can test each guideline or pattern on your own.

-   You can use each reference integration flow as a basis for creating more complex scenarios.


[How to Work with the Example Integration Flows](how-to-work-with-the-example-integration-flows-03e6959.md) contains information about how to use and execute the reference integration flows on your own tenant.
