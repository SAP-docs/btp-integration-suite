# Configure the IDoc Sender Adapter

The IDoc sender adapter enables SAP Integration Suite to receive Intermediate Document \(IDoc\) messages from a sender.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – select the adapter and choose *Update Version* from the property sheet. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

## Supported Headers

Header `SapAuthenticatedUserName` contains the user name of the client that calls the integration flow.

The following specific headers are set by the IDoc sender adapter and can be used in the subsequent steps of the integration flow.

-   SapIDocType

-   SapIDocTransferId

-   SapIDocDbId

> ### Tip:  
> The adapter supports processing of composite \(bulk\) messages if the composite message consists of individual messages with the same message type.
> 
> If a composite message is processed, the header `SapIDocTransferId` contains the ID of the first IDoc only. If you like to access all transfer IDs, you need to read the payload using an XPath expression \(for example, in a *Content Modifier* step\).

## Configuring the Adapter

Once you have created a sender channel and selected the IDoc adapter, you can configure the following attributes. To change the configurations, you need to configure a new channel.

The *General* tab shows general information such as the adapter type, its direction \(sender or receiver\), the transport protocol, and the message protocol.

Select the *Connection* tab and provide values in the fields as follows.

*Address*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Relative endpoint address on which Cloud Integration can be reached by incoming requests, for example, `/GetEmployeeDetails`.

> ### Note:  
> When you specify the endpoint address `/path`, a sender can also call the integration flow through the endpoint address `/path/<any string>` \(for example, `/path/test/`\).
> 
> Be aware of the following related implication: When you in addition deploy an integration flow with endpoint address `/path/test/`, a sender using the `/path/test` endpoint address will now call the newly deployed integration flow with the endpoint address `/path/test/`. When you now undeploy the integration flow with endpoint address `/path/test`, the sender again calls the integration flow with endpoint address `/path` \(original behavior\). Therefore, be careful *reusing* paths of services. It is better using completely separated endpoints for services.

Invalid XML Character Handling

</td>
<td valign="top">

Select how to handle XML documents containing characters which are not valid in XML version 1.0/1.1. Depending on the XML version of the source message, the adapter checks the characters against the respective range allowed. Choose between the following options:

-   *Throw Error*: An error is thrown during runtime.

-   *Remove*: Invalid characters are removed.

-   *Substitute*: Invalid characters are substituted by \#.


If this configuration option is not available \(because your are using an older version, for example\), the default behavior is to throw an exception.

> ### Note:  
> A character is considered valid, if it is part of the range listed here:
> 
> -   *Character Range for XML 1.0*:
> 
>     `#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]`*/\* any Unicode character, excluding the surrogate blocks, FFFE, and FFFF. \*/*

>     See also: [https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/\#charsets](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#charsets).
