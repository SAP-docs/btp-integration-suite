# RFC Receiver Adapter

Connects an SAP Cloud Integration tenant to a remote receiver system using Remote Function Call \(RFC\).

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter – edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your company’s policies.

You can use Remote Function Call \(RFC\) to integrate on-premise ABAP systems with the systems hosted on the cloud using the Cloud connector, and also with S/4 HANA Cloud system available in public internet.

> ### Note:  
> Before you can deploy your integration flow, you need to have defined the required RFC destination for your application.
> 
> To create destinations you need to either have administrator or developer role in SAP BTP cockpit. For more information on how to create RFC destinations, see [Creating an RFC Destination](creating-an-rfc-destination-3b55fa7.md). Also you need to have the remote function module XSD file. For more information on how to generate XSD file, see [Generating XSD/WSDL for Function Modules Using ESR \(Process Integration\)](generating-xsd-wsdl-for-function-modules-using-esr-process-integration-57a6b6e.md).
> 
> Follow the steps to generate WSDL function modules for those who don’t have access to on-premise \(Process Integration\) system:
> 
> 1.  Identify the required function module and the backend system to where the function module is called.
> 
> 2.  Login to the backend system and start SICF transaction to maintain services for HTTP communication.
> 
> 3.  Activate the Internet Communication Framework \(ICF\) service to make it accessible.
> 
> 4.  Access the backend application to generate and fetch the WSDL for the desired function module.
> 
>     `https://<backend_host>:<backend_https_port>/sap/bc/soap/wsdl11?services=<function_module_name>`

RFC executes the function call using synchronous communication, which means that both systems must be available at the time the call is made. When the call is made for the function module using the RFC interface, the calling program must specify the parameters of the connection in the form of an RFC destination. RFC destinations provide the configuration needed to communicate with an on-premise ABAP and S/4 HANA cloud systems through an RFC interface.

The RFC destination configuration settings are used by the SAP JAVA Connector \(SAP JCo\) to establish and manage the connection with on-premise and S/4 HANA cloud system available in public internet. To further understand the destination configuration properties, see [Creating an RFC Destination](creating-an-rfc-destination-3b55fa7.md). While you configure a destination make sure to select `internet` as the proxy type to establish connection with an application over the internet.

> ### Remember:  
> -   The RFC adapter supports SAP NetWeaver 7.31 and higher.
> 
> -   The RFC adapter supports Synchronous RFC \(sRFC\) and Transactional RFC \(tRFC\).
> 
> -   From RFC adapter version 1.2.0, function modules that contains "/" in their names are also supported. For these function modules you need to replace "/" with "\_-" \(underscore and hyphen\) in the input XML.
> 
> -   The date provided in the input XML must be of format "YYYY-MM-DD".
> 
> -   If the parameters of the ABAP function are changed, the integration flow containing the RFC adapter must be redeployed for the new parameters to be reflected in the output XML. However, this doesn't hold good in case the RFC adapter is configured with dynamic destination. For the changed parameters to be reflected in the output, the integration flow must be redeployed with the static destination only.

Once you have created a receiver channel and selected the RFC Receiver Adapter, you can configure the following attributes. See [Overview of Integration Flow Editor](overview-of-integration-flow-editor-db10beb.md).

Select the *General* tab and provide values in the fields as follows.

Select the *Connection* tab and provide values in the fields as follows.

Enter the RFC destination configured in SAP BTP cockpit for your application.

> ### Note:  
> You can create dynamic destinations by using expressions \(header, property\) in the Content Modifier.
> 
> 1.  Select Content Modifier in the integration flow. Then, go to Message Header in Content Modifier properties and set header value as the destination name. For example, abc.
> 2.  Select your RFC adapter and. In the *Destination* field, assign dynamic destination by using the expression: $\{header/property.header/property name\}. For example $\{header.abc\} or $\{property.abc\} where abc is the value of the header or property.

*Send Confirm Transaction* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

\(Applicable to BAPI functions\) By default this option is disabled. You can enable this option if you want to support BAPI functions that require BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_COMMIT to be invoked implicitly by the RFC receiver adapter.

> ### Note:  
> Ensure the following ABAP functions are allowlisted in Cloud connector before using this option:
> 
> -   BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_COMMIT
> 
> -   BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_ROLLBACK

> ### Caution:  
> If you enable this option for non-BAPI functions, BAPI\_TRANSACTION\_COMMIT can still be invoked, which is redundant and hence may impact RFC function execution time.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Create New Connection* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

If you enable this option, the adapter creates a new RFC connection in the backend system, every time a new call is made to the target system.

> ### Remember:  
> This option must be selected if you are using principal propagation. If you do not select this option, principal propagation will not work as expected.
