# IP Filter

The IP filter policy allows or denies calls from specific IP addresses or address ranges.

This policy is used to selectively allow or deny access for an IP address or group of IP addresses. Use this policy when you want to limit access to APIs to only a specific IP address or group of IP addresses. For example, if you only want systems \(computers, mobile, etc\) under the control of your enterprise to access the APIs exposed in your test environment, you can allow \(allowlist\) the IP address range for your internal network. Developers working from home can access these APIs using VPN.

> ### Note:  
> For the IP filter policy to work correctly, the *Client IP Preservation* feature needs to be enabled on the Edge Lifecycle Management. For more information, see [Deploy the Edge Integration Cell Solution](../deploy-the-edge-integration-cell-solution-ab81b84.md).

See the following video for visual instructions on how to add and configure the IP filter policy:

## IP Masking with CIDR Notation

CIDR \(Classless Inter-Domain Routing\)\*\* is a method for specifying a range of IP addresses using a mask. It works with both IPv4 and IPv6, but we'll focus on IPv4 for simplicity, as that's what we support.

IPv4 addresses are divided into groups of numbers separated by periods \(e.g., 198.51.100.1\). Each group represents 8 bits, so the entire IPv4 address is made up of 32 bits.

In binary, the IPv4 address 198.51.100.1 looks like this: 11000110.00110011.01100100.00000001

This breaks down into 4 groups of 8 bits, totaling 32 bits.

With CIDR, a range of IP addresses can be specified by appending a /number \(from 1 to 32\) to the IP address, like this: 198.51.100.1/24

In this case, the number 24 is used as the mask attribute value.

The notation 198.51.100.1/24 means that the first 24 bits must remain fixed, while the remaining bits can be any value from 0 to 255. For example:

> ### Example:  
> 
> <table>
> <tr>
> <th valign="top">
> 
> Fixed Portion
> 
> </th>
> <th valign="top">
> 
> Possible Values for the Last Group
> 
> </th>
> </tr>
> <tr>
> <td valign="top">
> 
> 198.51.100.
> 
> </td>
> <td valign="top">
> 
> 0 - 255
> 
> </td>
> </tr>
> </table>
> 
> The mask is applied at the end of the third group. This creates a clean division, essentially resulting in a mask like `198.51.100.*`. Typically, using multiples of 8 for IPv4.
> 
> IPv4: 8, 16, 24, 32
> 
> You can also use other values for finer control, which involves some binary calculation.

> ### Example:  
> Here's an example using a mask of 30, as in `198.51.100.1/30`:
> 
> 
> <table>
> <tr>
> <th valign="top">

> Fixed Part

> 
> 11000110.00110011.01100100.000000 \(first 30 bits\)
> 
> </td>
> <td valign="top">
>

> 
> </td>
> </tr>
> </table>
> 
> With the configuration `<SourceAddress mask="30">198.51.100.1</SourceAddress>`, the following IP addresses would be allowed \(or denied, depending on your rules\):
> 
> -   198.51.100.0
> -   198.51.100.1
> -   198.51.100.2
> -   198.51.100.3
