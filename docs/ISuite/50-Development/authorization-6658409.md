# Authorization

This policy evaluates whether a user should be permitted to access a protected API.

Different iFlow sender channels may have different authorizations and roles. For API artifact, different resources may have different authorization and roles configured.

Scope

<td valign="top">

Scope represents the list of roles that allow access to the API endpoint.

Please make sure that the user attempting to invoke the API endpoint is assigned at least one of the roles defined in the scope field.

> ### Note:  
> Either the role entered in the scope field should be preconfigured in the *User Roles* section of the *Monitor* view under the *Manage Security* section or you must add the role you've entered in the scope field in *User Roles*. To learn how to configure the role, see [Managing User Roles](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/managing-user-roles?q=Defining%20Permissions%20for%20Senders%20to%20Process%20Messages%20on%20a%20Runtime%20Node).

For example, if youâ€™ve configured a role called "APIArtifactUser" in *User Roles*, you must enter the role exactly as it is \(including case sensitivity\) in the scope field or vice versa.

Once the "APIArtifactUser" role is configured in *User Roles*, it is automatically added to the *Roles* in SAP BTP Cockpit.

To execute an API with the Authorization policy successfully on the runtime node, the "APIArtifactUser" role should be associated to the *Process Integration Runtime* instance. For step-by-step instruction on how to create a *Process Integration Runtime* instance, see [Invoke an API Artifact by Obtaining API Credentials through Process Integration Runtime](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6afa6d14ff6d4006b5614676722ef006/CLOUD/en-US/b63baa26290948e68fedabc10b35f33d.html "To invoke an API artifact via a REST client, you'll need authentication credentials, which are generated by creating a Process Integration Runtime instance.") :arrow_upper_right:.
