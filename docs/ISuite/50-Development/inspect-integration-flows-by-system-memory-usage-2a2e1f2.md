# Inspect Integration Flows By System Memory Usage

Inspect relative memory allocation per integration flow for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\).

The chart shows memory allocation and allows you to do a relative comparison of integration flows with regard to memory consumption.

> ### Note:  
> Heap memory is continuously allocated for processing messages, and it's automatically reclaimed by garbage collection when itâ€™s no longer used. If the allocated memory is high and can't be reclaimed by the garbage collector for a longer time, you can expect memory issues.
> 
> However, it's usual for an integration flow to have high throughput and allocate a lot of memory, as long as the memory is reclaimed fast enough. This is the normal mode of operation for high-throughput scenarios.

Only those integration flows that are identified as top consumers of memory in terms of allocation are shown \(sorted top-down by average usage\).

The color shade of a cell reflects the level of memory allocation. The darkest shade reflects the highest usage observed during the selected time period.

Choose a cell to display the degree of memory allocation and to access one of the following functions for the selected integration flow \(results are filtered according to the setting of the *Time* parameter\):

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar. For more information, see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md).

-   *Show Integration Content*

    Navigate to the *Manage Integration Content* screen for the related integration flow. For more information, see [Manage Integration Content](manage-integration-content-09a7223.md).

-   *Inspect Integration Flow*

    Inspect the system memory usage of the selected integration flow. For more information, see [Inspect Resource Consumption for Individual Integration Flow](inspect-resource-consumption-for-individual-integration-flow-3380bd6.md).

-   *Show Flow Step*

    Choose this function to navigate to the *Integration Designer*. The specific flow step identified as the main memory consumer is highlighted in the integration flow.

-   *Copy Flow Step to Clipboard*

    Copy the identifier of the integration flow step that was detected as the main consumer of memory to the clipboard. After navigating to the integration flow designer via the function *Show Integration Content*, you can use this identifier for finding the integration flow step within the integration flow.

    > ### Tip:  
    > On the *Manage Integration Content* screen, you can select *View Deployed Artifact* to navigate to the integration flow editor for the deployed artifact. Alternatively, you can select *Navigate to Artifact Editor* to navigate to the integration flow editor in the *Design* section.

-   *Copy Fow ID to Clipboard* 

    Copy the integration flow identifier to the clipboard. This is useful on screens where you can filter by integration flow using the artifact ID.

-   **Zoom Out** and **Zoom In** to extend/reduce the selected time period.
