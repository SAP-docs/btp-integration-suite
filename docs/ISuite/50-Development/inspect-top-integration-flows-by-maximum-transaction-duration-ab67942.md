# Inspect Top Integration Flows by Maximum Transaction Duration

Inspect maximum duration of database transactions per integration flow for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\).

Only those integration flows that are identified as top consumers of database connections are shown \(sorted top-down by average usage\).

The color shade of a cell reflects the maximum duration of database transactions. The darkest shade reflects the longest duration observed during the selected time period.

Click a cell to display the percent value of connection usage and to access one of the following functions for the selected integration flow \(results are filtered according to the setting of the *Time* parameter\):

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar. For more information, see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md).

-   *Show Integration Content*

    Navigate to the *Manage Integration Content* screen for the related integration flow. For more information, see [Manage Integration Content](manage-integration-content-09a7223.md).

-   *Show Message With Max. Duration*

    Navigate to the **Monitor Message Processing** screen and inspect the message processing log with the maximum duration for the selected integration flow and time interval. For more information, see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md).

-   *Inspect Integration Flow*

    Inspect the database transaction duration of the selected integration flow. For more information, see [Inspect Resource Consumption for Individual Integration Flow](inspect-resource-consumption-for-individual-integration-flow-3380bd6.md).

-   *Zoom Out* and *Zoom In* to extend/reduce the selected time period.
