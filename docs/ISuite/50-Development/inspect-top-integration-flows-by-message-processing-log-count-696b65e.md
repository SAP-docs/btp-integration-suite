# Inspect Top Integration Flows by Message Processing Log Count

Inspect the count of message processing logs by integration flows for a given time period \(as selected with the *Time* parameter\). Only integration flows that have the most message processing logs are displayed.

Integration flows are sorted top-down according to the count of message processing logs.

The color shade of a cell reflects the count of message processing logs.

Using the *Message Processing Status* combo box, you can filter the count of message processing logs by status. The default value is *All*. That means, the total count of message processing logs is displayed.

Choose a cell to get more context information and to get access to the following functions:

-   *Show Messages*

    Navigate to the *Monitor Message Processing* screen for the time period covered by the bar \(see [Monitor Message Processing](monitor-message-processing-314df3f.md)\).

-   *Show Integration Content*

    Navigate to the **Manage Integration Content** screen for the selected integration flow \(see [Manage Integration Content](manage-integration-content-09a7223.md)\).
