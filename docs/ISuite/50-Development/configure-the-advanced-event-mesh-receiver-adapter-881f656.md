# Configure the Advanced Event Mesh Receiver Adapter

The AdvancedEventMesh receiver adapter allows SAP Integration Suite to send messages to queues or topics in SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh.

> ### Note:  
> This adapter is available on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
> 
> For more information, see [Consuming Integration Adapters from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](consuming-integration-adapters-from-sap-business-accelerator-hub-b9250fb.md).
> 
> The availability of the adapter is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Notes [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776) and [3188446](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3188446).

> ### Note:  
> This adapter exchanges data with a remote component that might be outside the scope of SAP. Make sure that the data exchange complies with your companyâ€™s policies.

> ### Note:  
> -   If your current adapter version is 1.3.3 or lower, check SAP Note [3582690](https://me.sap.com/notes/3582690) before upgrading the adapter.
> -   If you run the intergration flow associated with the AEM adapter using *Run on a single worker node* configuration, there might be integration flow failures. To ensure smooth processing check SAP Note [3603502](https://me.sap.com/notes/3603502).

The adapter uses the Solace Message Format \(SMF\) message protocol.

The *General* tab displays general information about the adapter itself.

*Host* 

</td>
<td valign="top">

The IP address \(or host name\) to connect to. Multiple host entries separated by commas \(up to four\) are allowed for redundancy and failover. With multiple entries, each is tried in turn until one succeeds. Host contains one or more host entries \(up to four\).

A host entry has the form:

`[Protocol:]Host[:Port]`

Protocol is the protocol used for the transport channel. The valid values are:

-   `tcp` - use a TCP channel for communications between the application and its peers. If no protocol is set, tcp is used as a default.

-   `tcps` - use a SSL channel over TCP for communications between the application and its peers. The encryption with compression is not supported.


Host is the IP address \(or host name\) to connect to for a connection.

Port is the port to connect to for a connection. A value is only required when using a port other than the automatically assigned default port number. The default port for TCP is 55555 when compression is not in use, or 55003 when compression is in use. The default port for SSL is 55443.

For example, a valid entry looks like:

`tcps://192.168.1.50:55443,192.168.1.51:55443`

This specifies two hosts using SSL over TCP on port 55443.

The secured SMF host name of the event broker can be copied by navigating to the AEM service *Connect* \> *Solace Messaging* \> *Connection Details*. Copy the *Secured SMF Host* using the copy icon.

*Message Headers*

The adapter accepts headers on both sender and receiver side.

The receiver can support the following headers on the message being published to the broker: ApplicationMessageId, ApplicationMessageType, CoS, CorrelationId, DeliveryCount, Destination, DestinationEndpointType, Expiration, HttpContentEncoding, HttpContentType, IsDiscardIndication, IsDMQEligible, IsElidingEligible, IsRedelivered, IsReplyMessage, Priority, ReceiveTimestamp, ReplicationGroupMessageId, ReplyToEndpointType, ReplyToDestination, SenderId, SenderTimestamp, SequenceNumber, TimeToLive, UserProperties. When setting up the integration flow, add them to the allowlist via Integration Flow -\> Runtime Configuration -\> Allowed Header\(s\), if required. See [Specify the Runtime Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/specify-runtime-configuration). Some of these headers can be defined at design-time via the *Message Properties* tab and the rest could be defined using a Content Modifier.

Additionally, the header `SAP_MplCorrelationId` is propagated in every outgoing message as an entry in the UserProperties.
