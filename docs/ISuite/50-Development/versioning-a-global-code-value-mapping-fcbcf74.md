# Versioning a Global Code Value Mapping

Activate your global code value mapping.



## Context

Once you have created and saved your global code value mapping, you can activate the mapping to use it productively. There are 3 different types of status set for an code value mapping and each one of them is defined below:

-   *Draft*: When you create a new global code value mapping, the newly created code value mapping has the *Status* field set to *Draft* and the *Version* set as *1.0*. These details can be viewed in the *Overview* tab of your code value mapping. You can modify this new version according to your business requirements.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can also copy an existing code value mapping. The copied code value mapping will have the *Version* set as *1.0* and also the term *Copy* suffixed to its name. To know more, see [Global Code Value Mapping](global-code-value-mapping-fd1d3ff.md).

-   *Active*: After activating a global code value mapping, the *Status* is set to *Active*. Once activated, this version of the global code value mapping will be finalised and it cannot be edited thereafter.

    > ### Note:  
    > It is always recommended to activate a global code value mapping to use it productively. By doing so,
    > 
    > -   You protect the global code value mapping against any unwanted changes
    > 
    > -   Any new requirements for the global code value mapping can be maintained in a new *Draft* version without changing the active global code value mapping version currently in use.

-   *Deprecated*: After activating a global code value mapping, its previous active version gets deprecated and its *Status* field is set to *Deprecated*.

    > ### Note:  
    > There can be only one active and draft version of a particular global code value mapping.


To activate a global code value mapping, follow te procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Open the global code value mapping.

2.  Choose *Activate*.

    > ### Note:  
    > Activating a global code value mapping will render it read-only. To make further edits, you need to create a new draft version of the mapping

3.  In the confirmation dialog, choose *Confirm*.
