# Exporting Runtime Artifacts

Exporting Runtime Artifacts for Integration Solutions.

> ### Note:  
> Currently, SAP Integration Suite supports exporting runtime artifacts for and SAP Process Orchestration.
> 
> To know more about these runtime artifacts, refer to the blog [The Mapping Artifacts and their Purpose](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-advisor-the-mapping-runtime-artifacts-and-their-purpose/ba-p/13426356).

By exporting the runtime artifacts, the application automatically generates a number of schemes, scripts, and examples from a mapping guideline, including:

-   Schemes for **syntax conversion**, such as from EDI syntax to XML or vice versa

-   Schemes for precise **payload validation** against the rules and constraints defined in the message implementation guidelines
-   **Pre- and post-processing scripts** for presorting payloads or enriching them with additional required information for the mapping
-   Main mapping XSLT script
-   **Examples** for testing the artifacts in the runtime

    > ### Note:  
    > In the `<MIGName>_testdata_ICA.xml` file, for choice elements, some of the choice options are commented out to be XSD-valid. You can choose to change this in the xml file to have other elements uncommented or commented.


This automatic generation is a particularly enormous time saver because without the application, all these schemes, scripts, or payloads must be created separately and manually.

> ### Note:  
> In SAP Process Orchestration mode
> 
> -   Not all artifacts are relevant and therefore only fewer artifacts are exported.
> 
> -   Exporting MIGs and MAGs based on Tradacoms is not supported \(due to significant structural differences of the Tradacoms message structures\).

You can then import these runtime artifacts in either of these integration solutions and use them to implement your A2A/B2B integration scenario. See [Consuming Artifacts in Integration Flows](consuming-artifacts-in-integration-flows-a33a6c6.md)

## How to Export Runtime Artifacts?

1.  Access the Message Implementation Guideline \(MIG\) or the Mapping Guideline \(MAG\) section.
2.  Select the MIG or MAG in which you want to export the runtime artifacts.
3.  Choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> and then choose *Export*.
4.  You see two options for exporting the artifacts. Choose the appropriate option based on your needs.

## How to consume Runtime Artifacts?

The SAP Integration Suite works with any kind of interface/API format; its automatically generated artifacts can be used in a variety of runtimes or implementations. Each different runtime has specific approaches, formats, pre-conditions, and implementation instructions. These must be considered, if the generated runtime artifacts are implemented into these runtimes and if the involved applications will be connected. SAP’s intention is to provide templates and mechanisms that accelerate the onboarding of the runtime artifacts into the diverse supported runtime systems such as

-   SAP Process Orchestration

## Change of XSD file name for EANCOM

There is now an unified naming convention for these Message XSDs for all messages from EDIFACT and EDIFACT subsets. Therefore, Message XSDs for an EANCOM MIG will have a new file name which will comply to this naming convention. The details of this naming convention is:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Field

</th>
<th valign="top">

Value

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

New Naming Convention

</td>
<td valign="top">

UN-EDIFACT\_<MessageType\>\_<Version\>\_<AssociationCode\>.xsd

> ### Example:  
> -   UN-EDIFACT\_APERAK\_D01B.xsd
> 
> -   UN-EDIFACT\_APERAK\_D01B\_EAN003.xsd



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

MessageType

</td>
<td valign="top">

Type of message on which the MIG is based on. \(Corresponding to UNH \> S009 \> 0065.\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Version

</td>
<td valign="top">

EDIFACT version. In case of subsets, the version of the parent EDIFACT will be considered. \(Corresponding to UNH \> S009 \> 0052 and 0054.\)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

AssociationCode

</td>
<td valign="top">

Subset-specific code that identifies the Message Guideline. \(Corresponding to UNH \> S009 \> 0057.\)

> ### Note:  
> -   This is an optional part. It will be included into the XSD file name if the field *0057* contains either a *Fixed Value* or a single code value. Preference will be given to the *Fixed Value* set in the field.
> 
> -   If no unique value for *AssociationCode* is found in the MIG, the standard EDIFACT file name convention will be applied.



</td>
</tr>
</table>

> ### Note:  
> The old EANCOM naming convention is still supported. However, if there is an integration flow for EANCOM with old XSD files and you want to use Message XSD from the new SAP Integration Suite Export, then you would need to replace the older EANCOM files with the new UN-EDIFACT file in your EDI Flow Steps.

## Extended Namespace Support for MIGs

Few pointers to be considered for your MIGs for SAP S/4HANA SOAP type systems and Custom Messages created before June 2023.

> ### Note:  
> If your MIG is affected, you will see a warning icon for the root node in MIG Editor.

The application was extended in June 2023 to support namespace handling. Earlier, namespace prefixes were only allowed at the root node level and these prefixes were removed as part of internal processing. The recent addition of GS1 XML to our Type System library has enabled the support of XML elements and attributes which are a part of the namespace and require a namespace declaration.

To elaborate on the changes, a node will now carry its namespace prefix in the internal payload format if its required by the message standard. In other words, the namespace prefix will no longer be removed as part of the internal processing.

The change is relevant for the message types of the following type system:

-   S/4HANA Cloud SOAP

-   S/4HANA On-Premise SOAP
-   Custom Messages \(if the message is defined in a namespace\)

In case your MIG is affected by this change, you need to make sure to follow below guidelines \(particularly for the first new Export of Runtime Artifacts after the change date\). When you update your integration flow, you need to replace all the files using the latest export of runtime artifacts. You cannot update/replace only a few files as a mix of old and updated artifacts will cause compatibility issue.

You might come across the following scenarios while trying to update your integration flow:

-   Your MIG uses XSD Assertions and, the XPath of any of your MIG Assertions uses an absolute path starting from the root node.

    -   If this is the case, you need to change the XPath of your Assertion to include the namespace prefix of the root node.

    -   Or use a relative XPath starting from the level where you have defined the XSD Assertion.

-   •Your integration flow has an additional flow step within the internal processing and this flow step defines an absolute XPath including the root node.
    -   If so, you also need to add the root node namespace prefix to this XPath.


-   Your integration flow has an additional flow step within the internal processing and this flow step is executing an additional processing/transformation \(like a Groovy or XSLT script\).
    -   If so, you need to check if your script needs to be updated as well.
