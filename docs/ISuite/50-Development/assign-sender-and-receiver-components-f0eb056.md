# Assign Sender and Receiver Components

You use the Sender and Receiver elements to model remote systems that are connected to your integration flow \(either as sender or receiver of messages\).



## Procedure

1.  Open the integration flow in the editor.

2.  From the palette, choose *Participants* \(<span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span>\) and then *Sender* or *Receiver*.

## Next Steps

You can now connect the Sender or Receiver shape with an integration flow Start Message or End Message event. When performing this step, you also select the desired adapter type.
