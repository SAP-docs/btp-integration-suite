# Initiating the Message Broker

Initiate the message broker before you get started with the Event Mesh capability.



<a name="loio61eb5dd788ee4d5ba476842a5e5aa135__prereq_rdd_gch_hbc"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You must have activated the Event Mesh capability. See: [Activating and Managing Capabilities](activating-and-managing-capabilities-2ffb343.md).

-   You must have the *EventMeshAdmin* role collection assigned to you.




## Context

This task is a one-time activity. Before getting started with the actions associated with the Event Mesh capability, you must initiate the Event Mesh's broker. While doing so, you get to know the specifications of the broker, such as the spool size, maximum message size, and more.



## Procedure

1.  Choose *Configure* \> *Event Mesh*.

    The *Initiate Event Mesh* screen opens. You see the specifications of the broker.

2.  Choose *Activate*.

    The broker activation is in progress. Wait for a few seconds for this process to complete.

3.  Choose *OK* to complete the activation process.

    You remain in the *Configure* \> *Event Mesh* screen. You see the *Overview* tab where the broker specifications are displayed in a card with an *Active* status.
