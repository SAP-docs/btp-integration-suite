# Configuring User Access to SAP Integration Suite

Assign the required roles and role collections to users for accessing the individual capabilities.



<a name="loio2c6214a3228e4b4cba207f49fda92ed4__prereq_xvk_bm5_3tb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have the *Integration\_Provisioner* role assigned to you.

The *Integration\_Provisioner* role:

-   Gives you initial access to the SAP Integration Suite.
-   Lets you add and manage capabilities. See [Activating and Managing Capabilities](activating-and-managing-capabilities-2ffb343.md)

Once these steps are completed, you add users and assign the various roles associated with the respective capabilities. This process allows different users to access the necessary functionalities.



## Context

Once you’ve activated capabilities in the Integration Suite, you must assign users the required roles and role collections to access the functionality of these capabilities.

For more information on role collections, see [Roles and Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/14a877c6e2f14832999df500ffa6e05e.html).



## Procedure

1.  To assign role collections to a user, go to your subaccount and navigate to *Security* \> *Users*.

2.  Choose *Create* to add a new user.

    If the user details already exist in the subaccount, you can skip step 2 and 3 and continue from step 4.

3.  Enter the *User Name* and *E-Mail*, and choose *Create*.

4.  Choose the user and under *Role Collections* section select <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> Additional Options and choose *Assign Role Collection*.

5.  In the resulting dialog box, select the checkbox of the role collection that you want to assign to the user and choose *Assign Role Collection*.

    The following role collections are available for each capability in SAP Integration Suite:

    **Roles**
