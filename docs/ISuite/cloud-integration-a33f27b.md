# Cloud Integration

Cloud Integration allows you to build and run integration flows across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid landscapes for application-to-application \(A2A\), business-to-business \(B2B\), and business-to-government \(B2G\) scenarios.

This capability allows you to discover, design, and operate scenarios for end-to-end process integration.

It supports end-to-end process integration through the exchange of messages.

You can process messages in real-time scenarios spanning different companies, organizations, or departments within one organization.

## API Access

Cloud Integration provides APIs for accessing and managing resources, which can be tested on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. To interact with Cloud Integration using the API, you must create a service instance and service key for inbound authentication.

APIs are provided on the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/), where you can test the APIs against your existing tenants.

You can use standard HTTP methods \(for example, the GET method\) to call the API.

You can access the OData APIs at [Cloud Integration \(SAP Business Accelerator Hub\)](https://api.sap.com/package/CloudIntegrationAPI/odata). There you can also find detailed descriptions of each API call.
