# Copying Keystore Entries in Edge Integration Cell

The Keystore Monitor allows a tenant administrator to manage the tenant keystore and its entries \(X.509 certificates and key pairs\).

> ### Note:  
> For details on the list view as well as on how to create, add, or upload security artifacts, see: [Managing Keystore Entries](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/managing-keystore-entries?version=CLOUD&q=keystore).

> ### Note:  
> You can assign a runtime to one keystore only, but you can assign a keystore to several runtimes. If you assign only one runtime to an exiting keystore, this keystore is only available for this single runtime.
> 
> Remember:
> 
> -   The maximum size of a keystore assigned to an edge runtime is 1 MB.
> 
> -   The maximum number of keystores is limited to 20 per tenant.
> 
> -   You can assign up to 20 runtimes to a keystore.
> -   The maximum number of Edge Integration Cell instances is 20 per tenant.

> ### Caution:  
> To change the existing assignment of a keystore to a specific runtime, can cause message processing failures.
