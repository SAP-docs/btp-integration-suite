# Data Store Sender Adapter

This adapter enables Cloud Integration to consume messages from a data store. This feature helps you to enable asynchronous decoupling of inbound and outbound processing by using the data store as temporary storage.

To understand the concept of asynchronous decoupling, assume that a sender sends a message to Cloud Integration \(inbound processing\). If there's an error in outbound processing \(for example, a receiver can't be reached temporarily\), the middleware \(Cloud Integration\) retries message processing independently. There's no need that the sender triggers a reprocessing of the message as soon as the error situation is fixed. The sender relies on the middleware to do that. To support this scenario, Cloud Integration stores the message received from the sender in the data store. To implement this step, you can design a dedicated integration flow that receives the sender's message and uses a *Data Store Write* step to store it in the data store \(see [Define Data Store Write Operations](define-data-store-write-operations-46260ee.md)\).

Furthermore, you model outbound processing in an integration flow that initially consumes the message from the data store \(using the *Data Store* sender adapter\). The outbound integration flow retries the message from the data store as long as the error situation lasts.

The following figure depicts the described example setup.

You can model the steps that write into the data store and those that consume message from it also in the same integration flow.

If multiple worker nodes are set up, there's no parallel processing of the same data store entry by these multiple worker nodes.

## Default Headers
Each time an Iflow is triggered via this Adapter the following Headers are present:

*Headers have to be listed in Allowed Header(s) for Iflow*

> ### Tip:  
> You can use this feature to implement scenarios with quality of service Exactly Once for cases when the sender hasn't any mechanism in place to retry messages.

> See: [Quality of Service Exactly Once](quality-of-service-exactly-once-f96cf27.md)

> ### Note:  
> Availability of this feature:
> 
> -   Cloud Foundry environment: Availability of this feature depends upon the SAP Integration Suite service plan that you use. For more information about different service plans and their supported feature set, see SAP Note [2903776](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2903776).
> 
> -   Neo environment: This feature is available for all editions.

> ### Note:  
> In the following cases certain features might not be available for your current integration flow:
> 
> -   You are using a runtime profile other than the one expected. See: [Runtime Profiles](../IntegrationSettings/runtime-profiles-8007daa.md).
> 
> -   A feature for a particular adapter or step was released after you created the corresponding shape in your integration flow.
> 
>     To use the latest version of a flow step or adapter â€“ edit your integration flow, delete the flow step or adapter, add the step or adapter, and configure the same. Finally, redeploy the integration flow. See: [Updating your Existing Integration Flow](updating-your-existing-integration-flow-1f9e879.md).

To use this adapter type in an integration flow, connect a *Sender* with a *Start Message* shape and select adapter type *Data Store*.

Once you've created a *Data Store* sender channel, you can configure the following attributes.

Go to the *General* tab to configure the following adapter parameters.

*Data Store Name*

</td>

Specifies the name of the data store \(no white spaces\).

The maximum length allowed for the data store name is 40 characters. If you enter a longer string, a validation error is raised. Note that this length restriction applies to the value that is used for this parameter at runtime.

*Visibility*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Defines whether the data store is shared by all integration flows \(deployed on the tenant\) or only by one specific integration flow.

-   *Global*: Data store is shared across all integration flows deployed on the tenant.

-   *Integration Flow* \(default setting\): Only a single integration flow uses the data store. A data store configured with this setting is also referred to as local data store.

<tr>

*Poll Interval \(in s\)*

</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the poll interval in seconds to wait before consuming messages from the data store. The default is set to 10 s. The minimum is set to 1 s. The maximum is set to 300 s.

The adapter continuously consumes messages from the data store if the data store contains entries that are ready to be processed.

The poll interval only becomes effective as soon as the data store doesn't contain such entries anymore. From that point in time, the adapter waits for the time specified by the *Poll Interval* parameter and then again tries to consume messages from the data store.

> ### Note:  
> The smaller the poll interval \(for example, 1 s or less\), the more load is put on the data store.

Enter a value for the amount of time to wait before retrying message delivery. The default is set to 1 min. The minimum is set to 1 min. The maximum is set to 1440 min \(24 hours\).
