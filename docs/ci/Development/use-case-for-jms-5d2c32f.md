# Use Case for JMS

Using message queues \(JMS queues\), you can implement asynchronous decoupling of messages in an improved way as compared with using the data store \(see [Use Cases for Data Store and Variables](use-cases-for-data-store-and-variables-853d4dd.md)\).

To connect to the JMS queue, you use the JMS sender and receiver adapter like shown in the following process flow.

1.  Integration flow 1 stores the message \(received from the sender\) in the JMS queue using the JMS receiver adapter.

2.  The message broker pushes the message to integration flow 2 \(through the JMS sender adapter\).

3.  Integration flow 2 sends the message to the receiver.


If there's a transfer failure, the message is retried automatically from the message broker.

Integration flow 2 can process multiple messages in parallel. That way, the performance in high volume scenarios is improved.

> If you'd like to set up a simple example scenario using JMS queues, check out [Apply the Retry Pattern with JMS Queue](apply-the-retry-pattern-with-jms-queue-da17d2d.md).
